            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>If we looke upon our ſelves as we lye in the loynes of our firſt parents, we are a part of that tainted ſeed that might juſtly inherit thy wrath: our underſtandings are darkened; and our wills in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of conformity to thine, are growne rebellious; in as much as that by nature, there is not one good thought in us; but a prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to all evill whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And if we conſider our ſelves in our actuall tranſgreſſions by our ſinnes of ignorance, our ſinnes of infirmity, and of doubting, our ſinnes againſt our owne knowledge, and againſt our vowes and purpoſes, and promiſes of better obedience; Wee have greatly diſhonoured thy glorious name, and grieved thy good Spirit, and weakened thy graces more and more within us, and have juſtly expoſed our ſelves to thy eternall curſe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:158707:4"/>
            <p>Even at this time, Holy Father, in the middeſt of thy Temple, we come before thee clogged with ſo many imperfections; that if thou ſhouldeſt be extreame to marke what is done amiſſe, the beſt of us were never able to abide it. It is thine infinite mercie that we are not conſumed; and therefore doe we live to put up this poore imperfect prayer to thee, becauſe thy compaſſions fail not.</p>
            <p>But, O God, though in our ſelves we be miſerable, and weak, and forlorne; ſuffer us to caſt up our eyes to the hills from whence commeth our helpe, to importune thee by the Gracious Name of Father, and to intreat thee for the merits of the Sonne of thy love, to be mercifull to us. Remember thine owne promiſe, that if we confeſſe our ſinnes, and leave them, and come to thee in the Sonne of thy love, we ſhall finde mercy. Lord we renounce our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſinnes; it grieves us that we can be no more ſorry for the ſame. By the bleſſed aſſiſtance of thy holy Spirit, we intend to live more conſcionably for the time to come.</p>
            <p>And we come to thee for Chriſts ſake, deſiring thee to ſpeake peace to our ſoules through his bloud, bury all our ſinnes in his grave, that they may never riſe up in this world (to ſhame us, and to be a reproach unto us, to terrifie our conſciences to deſperation, to intercept thy bleſſings, or our prayers) or in the world to come everlaſtingly to condemne us.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the foundation of all our comfort ſtands in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of this. Lord multiply to every one of our ſoules the bleſſed evidences of this thy reconciliation. Send the holy Spirit of thy Son into every of our hearts to renue us to that glorious Image of thine from whence we are fallen, and that may worke every ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace in us; True faith in thy promiſes, that though thou kill us we may truſt in thee, reſolution in all good cauſes, feare and reverence of thy glorious Majeſty; a groaning and daily mourning under our owne imperfections that ever we offended ſo good a God, and ſo gracious a Father: a good uſe making of all the afflictions, and chaſtiſements upon others. And teach every one of us, upon whom theſe dayes of our peace and proſperity, and health are renewed (who know not how ſoone we may be drawn to a recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning)
<pb facs="tcp:158707:4"/>to prepare our ſelves, that whenſoever thou ſhalt come neare us, either by that generall, or more particular judgements, wee may be able to ſtand in the day of our viſitation.</p>
            <p>And becauſe thou of thine infinite wiſdome haſt ſet apart the Miniſtery of thy Word to fit us for that time.

Circumciſe the hearts and eares of this people, that they may heare attentively, treaſure it up in their hearts carefully, and bring forth the fruit in their lives and converſations conſcionably, to thy glory, and the aſſurance of their owne ſalvation in the day of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.

            <p>O Lord our God, great in Majeſty, and infinite in Power; and in Jeſus Chriſt our moſt mercifull and loving Father: we poore, and wretched ſinners are here again by thy providence aſſembled in thy Sanctuary, to be made partakers of the good of thy houſe.

            <p>For beſides that originall corruption, wherein wee were borne and conceived and which like a leproſie hath over ſpread all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers &amp; faculties both of ſoul and body;) we have heaped up a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berles number of actuall tranſgreſſions. There is not any of thy holy Commandements, but in thought, word and deed, moſt grievouſly, and frequently we have violated. And which advanceth our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and heightens our rebellion, theſe evills have not only eſcaped us in the times of ignorance, but even ſince it hath pleaſed thee to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten us with the knowledge of thy truth: ſo that notwithſtanding thy mercies, thy judgements, the motions of thy good Spirit; the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed light of thy Goſpell afforded to us, we have continued the courſe of our rebellion againſt thee: yea that we may be yet more vile in thy preſence, even at this time when we come before thee, we are clogged with ſo many imperfections, that if thou ſhouldeſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame to marke what is done amiſſe, how mighteſt thou plague us in our bodies, in our goods, in our good names? how mighteſt thou fill us with the fury of an unpacified conſcience, and write bitter things againſt us, and a wounded ſpirit who can beare? How migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thou give us up to a reprobate ſence to commit ſinne with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe, and puniſh one evill with another; and after all this caſt us into that place of torment, to ſucke out the dregs of thy vialls? O God, in all this thou ſhouldeſt be juſtified, and clear when thou are judged, and we deſervedly puniſhed.</p>
            <p>Our ſinnes, our ſinnes, O Lord, call to heaven for vengeance; the pit is ready to ſhut her mouth upon us, if thou wert not the Lord of mercies. But thou haſt opened a way for poore diſtreſſed ſinners to come to thee through thy Son. We flye to the horns of the Altar, and intreat thee for Jeſus Chriſt ſake to be mercifull to us.</p>
            <p>And thou ſweet Saviour of the world, whoſe name imports mercy, and whoſe worke brought ſalvation for the ſons of men; thou knoweſt that we are but fleſh, and remembreſt that we are but duſt. Thou that art a High Prieſt touched with our infirmities, that knoweſt the power, &amp; ſtrength of old <hi>Adam</hi> how it leads us captive to ſin and wickednes; ſtand between us, &amp; the wrath of thy offended Father, mediate our cauſe with thy Father, that all our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb facs="tcp:158707:5"/>may be done away by thy ſufferings, that we may ever finde to our comfort, that though we have done ill, we have an advocate with the Father, Ieſus Chriſt the righteous. And doe thou, dear Father, every day more and more aſſure and perſwade our ſouls that thou art reconciled to us in thy Son, by ſending his Spirit into our hearts to renue us to that glorious Image of thine from whence wee are fallen; and which may enable us to performe every good duty: that as heretofore we have given our bodies and ſoules to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of unrighteouſneſſe; ſo in every part and power of them we may glorifie thee our God and Saviour, and as much time as remains in the fleſh, worke out our ſalvation with feare and trembling.</p>
            <p>And be cauſe thou of thine infinite wiſdome haſt ſet apart the Miniſtery of thy Word for this purpoſe; good Lord bleſſe it to us at all times, and at this time. Enable me that am to ſpeake, the moſt unworthy of all the ſons of <hi>Levi:</hi> Lord cover all my ſins and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold imperfections in that mercy of thine that hath no meaſure; and be pleaſed ſo to aſſiſt me by thy more particular helpe, that I may deliver thy word, boldly, truly, feelingly, and ſincerely. Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the hearts and eares of this thy people, that they may heare at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively, treaſure it up in their hearts carefully, and bring it forth in their lives and converſations conſcionably, to thy glory, and aſſurance of their owne ſalvation in the day of Jeſus Chriſt; to whom with thee, O Father, and thy bleſſed Spirit, be aſcribed, as is moſt due, all honour and glory, both now, and for evermore.</p>

            <head>Prayer after Sermon.</head>
            <p>VVEE returne unto thy Majeſty, O Lord our God, moſt humble and hearty thankes for all thy mercies moſt plentifully beſtowed upon us, as election creation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, preſervation, vocation; for the time and means thou haſt given us of repentance, whereas thou mighteſt have took us away in the middeſt of our ſins. O God, what are we, or what is our fathers houſe, that thou ſhouldeſt bee thus mercifull to us, to prevent and to follow us with thy kindneſſe? we are leſſe then the leaſt of thy mercies; yet ſuffer us to take the cup of ſalvation, and to praiſe thy Name: accept of our poor acknowledgement; adde one mercy more, deare God, to the common heap; grant that we may expreſſe our thankfulneſſe in a godly care of all holy obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Bleſſe that part of thy word that we have heard delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at this time; Good Lord, make it effectuall to our ſouls to ſalvation, grant that it may bring forth fruit, in ſome twenty, in ſome thirty, in ſome ſixty, in ſome a hundred fold; though in ſome more, and in ſome leſſe yet in all ſome, to the henour of thy Name.</p>
            <p>Bleſſe with us thy whole Church, whereſoever diſperſed, or howſoever diſtreſſed on the face of the earth; and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per O God, the cauſe of the ſame where ever it is maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in all the world, as may be for the confounding of the Kingdom of Sin and antichriſt, and for the encouragement of all ſuch as profeſſe thy Goſpel in ſincerity.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:158707:6"/>
            <p>Bleſſe us in theſe Kingdomes; continue to us our liberty, forgive our crying ſinnes, turne away thy judgements, open our eyes at laſt to ſee the day of our viſitation. Bleſſe thy ſervant our Sovereigne, <hi>Charles,</hi> by thy Grace, King of <hi>England, Scotland, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> in all cauſes, and over all perſons, as well Eccleſiaſticall as Civill, next and immediately under thy Son ſupreme governour. Bleſſe the Queens moſt excellent Majeſty, Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> the Princeſſe Palatine, and her iſſue. The Lords of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties moſt honourable Privy Councell. The whole Nobility. Bleſſe thine owne inheritance, the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> by what names or titles ſoever they be called. And for a ſupply of <hi>Davids</hi> Towers with Worthies, bleſſe all Schooles of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the two Vniverſities of this Land, <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford.</hi> Bleſſe all Congregations, this committed to my charge.</p>
            <p>Remember all that are in affliction in mercy, whether outwardly in body, or inwardly in minde, or for the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of a good conſcience. Lord draw neare to every of them according to their deſires. Receive us, Deare God, and all ours, and all thine into thy love and favour, and protection, thereſt of this day, and for ever. Let thy holy hand protect us, let thy bleſſed Spirit direct us; vouchſafe, good God to goe in and out before us. Keepe in us a purpoſe never to ſin; confirm it more and more: and upon every ſuggeſtion to ſin, let us call to minde our vowes, and promiſes of better obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and though we have dealt falſely before, now make them more powerfull to reſtraine us. If we fall by infirmity, let our hearts ſmite us ſpeedily; reſtore us by repentance im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; evermore keep us from impenitencie, hardneſſe of heart, and preſumption, the power of Satan, and a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall into ſin.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:158707:7"/>
            <p>Grant us all other things that thou in thy wiſdome knoweſt better that we want, then we to aske; not for any merits of ours, we diſclaime them; nothing belongs to us but ſhame and confuſion: but even for thy Names ſake, for thy promiſe ſake, for Ieſus Chriſts ſake the Sonne of thy love, and our Saviour, in whoſe Name, we further call upon thee, as he hath taught us, ſaying, <hi>Our Father which art, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>In this firſt judgement which is of frogs, we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve theſe three things.
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, the <hi>denunciation</hi> of it.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, the <hi>execution</hi> of it.</item>

            </p>
            <p>The denunciation of it in the firſt 4 verſes.</p>
            <p>The execution, in verſe 5.6.</p>
            <p>The event of it is threefold.</p>
            <p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, the Magicians doe the like verſe 7.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, thence there is a remoovall of this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the meanes of the ſame, from the beginning of verſe 8. to the end of verſe 15.</item>
                  <item>The third event is the obduration, and further hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the heart of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> verſe 16.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Come again to the denunciation, there are two things in it.
<list>
                  <item>Firſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> from <hi>God</hi> makes a motion to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to diſmiſſe his people, verſe 1.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, hee tells him upon his refuſall of a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and there is,</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt laid down what the judgement ſhould be, frogs.</p>
            <p>Then the amplification of it, from the generality, in all his borders, in his bedchamber, in their troughs, their baking-troughs, and their ovens, they ſhall be a vexation to them night and day.</p>
            <p>And then for the noyſomeneſſe of them, that they ſhould crawle about in all theſe places.</p>
            <p>Now for the motion, which is laid downe in verſe 1. that I may not <hi>reciprocari ſerram,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeakes, I will not draw my ſaw the ſame way againe; I willingly omit many thinges that might bee obſerved in this verſe.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:158707:8"/>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, Gods manner of ſpeaking to <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Secondly, <hi>Moſes</hi> going in to <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Thirdly, his manner of ſpeaking to <hi>Pharaoh, Thus ſaith the Lord:</hi> Whereby hee would perſwade him that hee was ſent by God; therefore he that ſent him would not brooke a refuſall.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Likewiſe in the fourth place, how equall the motion of God was, <hi>Let my people goe:</hi> he requires his owne of <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> And how they were ſaid to be Gods people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other people in the world.</p>
            <p>To the end <hi>that they may goe and ſerve me.</hi> The rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is between God and his people, it ties the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God to ſerve him, to obſerve him.</p>
            <p>Againe, how God would have them goe out of Egypt to ſerve him; that is, to offer ſacrifice. For hee would not have them ſerve him there, where the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians (inſtead of joyning with them) would deride them, nay not only ſo, but miſchiefe them: for ſuch was the zeale of the Egyptians againſt ſacrifice. All theſe I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and purpoſely omit.</p>
            <p>Now, (my beloved) in this verſe as it is a tranſition to that that followes, I will onely remember you of three things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>The firſt is the obſtinacie of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>The ſecond is the longanimity, and longſuffering of God.</item>
               <item>The third is the piety, and obedience of <hi>Moſes:</hi> all which are implied in this firſt verſe.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, the obſtinacie of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> hee had ſeene ſignes already: the Rod turned into a Serpent; and the rod of <hi>Moſes</hi> devouring the Serpents of the Egyptians. He had likewiſe ſeene that fearfull judgement, the water turned
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:158707:9"/>into blood. In which judgement both he, and the prime of the land, it may bee might eſcape more eaſily. It is likely they might quench their thirſt, by wine, or by ſome juyce, or liquors: but we muſt needs conceive that it went hard with the generality of the people, that either muſt dye for thirſt, or drinke blood: if they forbeare they dye; if they drinke, in probability they periſh; blood being ſo incongruous drinke for the body of man.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, though he had ſeene the Magicians doe the like, yet they could not remove the judgement: the Lord in his meere mercy, without any ſuit of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> or of his people put an end after ſeven dayes to that great affliction: yet notwithſtanding this, ſee the obduration of the wicked mans heart, he had need of a new judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to rouze him. My obſervation is this,
<q>How many blowes a hard heart will indure, before it breake, or be mollified.</q> See it in <hi>Balaam,</hi> he was not warned by the Aſſes tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of the way; nor yet by the Aſſes ruſhing againſt the wall to the bruiſing of his foot; nor yet by the Aſſes lying downe under him, and opening his mouth againſt him, his heart was ſet, he loved the wages of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, on he goes. So with <hi>Balack</hi> the King of Moab whom he ſerved. The firſt time he builds ſeven Altars, and ſacrificeth on them, and the ſecond time ſeven, and the third time ſeven with more opportunity: and though he ſaw that every time it was like a piece charged againſt another, that recoyled upon himſelfe; though hee ſaw how fruſtranious, and empty all his intendments, and purpoſes were, yet for all that he goes on in the hardnes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:158707:9"/>of his heart. God ſought meanes to reclaime him, hee defeated his purpoſes, but he would not yeeld; as if hee had held it an honour to be tenacious of his reſolution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God.</p>
            <p>Thus it was with <hi>Saul,</hi> what a number of blowes did God give that hard heart of his, before it would melt? Every time he diſappointed him in his purſuit of <hi>David,</hi> it was a blow given to molifie his heart (if it might have beene) yet he goes on to a greater degree of iniquity, and impiety, and he reinforceth, and reneweth his curſed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours againſt an innocent man.</p>
            <p>If the heart of man be but of a mettall, that is hard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough God knowes; yet it may be melted though it be iron, as <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> ſaith, it will melt in the fire: but if the heart of man be that heart of ſtone, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19. well may it be broken, but melt it will not. And it is not eaſily broken neither, many blowes will goe to the breaking of it. If the heart of man were onely as wine, or water, it were eaſily powred out: but if the heart of man come to be as lees, and thoſe ſetled, nay frozen, there is no way to empty them but to breake the veſſell, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 48.11.</p>
            <p>The Uſe of it in a word ſhall be to us all, to feare this fearfull judgement of obduration and hardneſſe of heart. It is found in a degree in the beſt of Gods children; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay let us all feare it. <hi>Peter</hi> in this was <hi>Petra,</hi> a piece of a rock; for it was not the firſt time that the cock crowed, nor the ſecond time, that could rouze him; hee was faine to crow the third time; and then he did not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten neither, but that Chriſt looked backe: Chriſt loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked back, and then <hi>Peter</hi> wept, the cold heart of <hi>Peter</hi> was thawed by the eyes of Chriſt, that are indeed as a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:158707:10"/>fire, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.14. And how many deare Saints of God complaine often of the ſtupidity and hardneſſe of their hearts? This I confeſſe, there is ſome ſoftneſſe that makes them feele that hardneſſe, yet they complain of ſome hardneſſe and obduration.</p>
            <p>Let us ever pray to God that he would give us tender hearts, that our hearts may ſmite us as <hi>Davids</hi> did upon the very cutting off of the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment, and upon his numbring of the people, as appears in thoſe books of <hi>Samuel.</hi> And that when God ſmites we may yeeld; that we doe not lead our ſelves ſo in our owne wayes to ſtand out with God. O let our ſinnes ever finde us, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeakes, judges, but not patrons of them, accuſers, but no defenders of miſchiefe. And upon the firſt ſummons let us yeeld, be ſure of that; for ſtanding out will but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our ſorrow. A ſenſeleſſenes, and aſtoniſhment of heart, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.28. A reprobate minde, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28. To be paſt feeling, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.19. To have a ſeared conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. O God if it be thy bleſſed will keepe us from. For, Beloved, ſuch a conſcience is that that <hi>Bernard</hi> calls <hi>Malum &amp; tranquillam,</hi> an evill conſcience, but a quiet one; and where ſuch a peace is, the Goſpell tells you who holds poſſeſſion. Therefore I ſay againe, and againe, <hi>whom God loveth he chaſteneth,</hi> and whom he chaſteneth, he makes him feele his blow, and indeed by their preſent yeelding in his mercy prevents their future ſuffering. That is the firſt thing, the obſtinacie of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the longanimity of God. Surely if wee wonder at <hi>Pharaohs</hi> obſtinacie, we have need as much to wonder at Gods longſuffering: for he having provoked God as he had done, by his itterated acts of cruelty and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:158707:10"/>blood, and oppreſſion upon the poore Iſraelites, having twice or thrice rejected Gods warnings, he having ſtood out not only a ſigne, but a judgement; that God ſhould admit him to a parley, that God ſhould vouchſafe him yet another admonition, and not cut him off that hee ſhould bee no more a burthen to the earth, certainly it was an argument of</p>
            <q>The long-ſuffering of God.</q>
            <p>And thus patient is God, and long-ſuffering towards the veſſells of wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. We finde it in <hi>Cain,</hi> and in the old world, and in the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and in <hi>Sodome.</hi> We finde it in Gods owne <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he bore with their cuſtomes in the wilderneſſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.18. and not only in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, but elſewhere; and ſo long till he was as a cart preſſed under ſheaves, as <hi>Amos</hi> ſpeakes: yea, till there was no remedy; for ſo himſelfe ſaith, 2 <hi>Chron. ult.</hi> God beares ſo long with wicked men oft-times, that as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> ſaith, men are apt to queſtion his providence, and his juſtice.</p>
            <p>And the Uſe of it (being a common point) let it bee this: Let not the ſonnes of <hi>Belial</hi> be encouraged to goe on in evill; for though God deferre, and ſuſpend the execution of wrath, according to their merit, yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly though God be long, yet he is not eternally patient. Juſtice muſt have a turne: ſurely the further the blow is fetched, the heavier it will light. God was not more frequent in warnings to the old world, then he was full in his judgements when he came.</p>
            <p>Take but one inſtance upon <hi>Iſrael;</hi> he wayted long for them; hee patiently expected, hee ſtood ſtill looking when they would returne, and if his feet had beene feete of braſſe, as hee deſcribed, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. ſurely hee
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:158707:11"/>would have beene wearie of ſtanding.</p>
            <p>Well, when it would not be, then he buckles himſelf; and for their <hi>Metropolis</hi> that was the glory of the whole earth, not one ſtone was left upon another; for the rivers that ran with milke, and honey, they were turned into blood: And for the ſurviving people and poſterity, they were vagabonds upon the face of the earth, and to this day for 1600. years are under a miſerable diſpertion. So will God doe with other ſonnes of wickedneſſe, that ſhall provoke him, though judgement be not preſently execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> doe not ſmart yet in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; afterwards God made him to know his long-ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and patience to the full. At laſt hee will puniſh: there will be bitterneſſe in the concluſion.</p>
            <p>This ſame cruell Tyrant <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when hee ſaw the former judgement removed hee began to bee bolder to ſinne. And as <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew ſaith in his firſt booke of the life of <hi>Moſes;</hi> he carried himſelfe as if juſtice had left the earth; as if it had been impoſſible (ſaith he) that he ſhould be puniſhed the ſecond time.</p>
            <p>So it fares with many <hi>Agags</hi> in the world, when either judgement is deferred, or hath been inflicted, and hee is rid of it; O ſaith he, <hi>The bitterneſſe of death is paſt:</hi> but the next news that wee heare is, that the ſword of <hi>Samuel</hi> thruſt him through, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. So God deales with thoſe that abuſe his lenity and long-ſuffering, that abuſed patience turnes to fury.</p>
            <p>Secondly, here is an <hi>item</hi> to Gods people, they may be comforted hence; if God be ſo long-ſuffering to the veſſels of wrath, ſurely, he will not be haſty, and inexorable toward his own children. If he be ſo good to thoſe that regard not his works, that grieve not for their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:158707:11"/>ſinnes; what will He be to thoſe that mourne for their iniquities, that tremble at his word, and ſeeke his face? I appeale to your conſciences, you that heare me, if you have not found God thus long-ſuffering, and gracious, hath he taken the advantage of every ſlip? nay hath hee tooke the advantage of every groſſer ſinne of yours that you have runne into through frailty? hath he not ſpared you as a father ſpares his ſonne? As I would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage you upon the long-ſuffering of God, to make a probate, and triall of his patience, and ſo to ſinne: So on the other ſide, I would not too much deject you, and caſt you downe: for ſurely God will yet call, and God will yet ſpeake admonitions, and ſpeake louder, to recall thoſe that have a minde to know him; and will ſpare yet a little longer, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>before they go hence, and be no more ſeen.</hi> That is the ſecond thing, the longanimity of God.</p>
            <p>The third thing is the piety of <hi>Moſes;</hi> Beloved, I gather it hence. <hi>Moſes</hi> is now to goe in to <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> It is like enough, God knew well enough his temper, or elſe hee would not have put him upon this ſervice. <hi>Moſes</hi> obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his obedience is the more remarkable in that hee was ſo averſe from this imployment in the beginning. For when God would ſend him, O by no means, he muſt ſend by whom he would ſend, and he makes many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes only to ſubterfuge this imployment: when God had taken away all his objections, then he comes to him, and when he comes there, he ſoone droopt, becauſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would not beleeve him for the anguiſh of their ſouls, and they were more afflicted: then he comes, and ſaith to God, <hi>How ſhall Pharaoh heare me, I am of uncircumciſed lips?</hi> And yet this man that was ſo averſe and fearfull to take the imployment upon him: Now God no ſooner
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:158707:12"/>ſpeakes, but he goes in to <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> My obſervation ſhall be this,</p>
            <q>What difference there is between men when they enter into a calling, and after when they have made ſome progreſſe in it.</q>
            <p>What a difference there is betweene a man when hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into good wayes, and after they have made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe in it. <hi>Noah</hi> was commanded of God to build an Arke, to condemne the world, and to ſave himſelfe: you muſt thinke he had many thoughts in his minde, and caſt a thouſand difficulties; yet he ſet on it, and by that time he was well entred into it, he goes on amaine, and neglects all the reproaches of the unjuſt world. So it was with <hi>Gedeon</hi> in the beginning of his imployment, he was a man wondrous fearfull, but afterward being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ruinate the Altar of <hi>Baal,</hi> he doth it readily, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 6. and after puts himſelfe upon imployment; hee grew to that reſolution that when his Army did fall from 32000, to three hundred, he dares meet the Madianites hand to hand, though they were ſpread upon the ground as Graſhoppers. See how courage increaſeth in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploymen:</p>
            <p>I knew a man that had good gifts that was afraid to enter into the Miniſtery, and he forecaſted the trouble and the labour, but after he was entred, and had accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med himſelfe that way, hee found much comfort and chearfulneſſe, and was wondrouſly inabled to doe above all that he conceived. And ſo in the courſe of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracie.</p>
            <p>I will uſe no more inſtances but that of regeneration; the entring into the ſpirituall ſtate, as a man doth in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. The new birth is not without many pangs, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:158707:12"/>throws, and convulſions, and the doore to it is wondrous ſtrait; for you muſt know that our nature is ſo farre from being diſpoſed to good, that it is infinitly prone to ill. And then a man hath much adoe to take his leave, and to bid adieu to the delights and pleaſures that hee inured and accuſtomed himſelfe to.</p>
            <p>And then the Devill oppoſeth the entring of a man here as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did the Iſraelites when they were to goe out of Egypt: he multiplies all his forces againſt him. So he did with the man in the Goſpel when he was to be caſt out, he tore him, and rent him, and laid him for dead.</p>
            <p>Againe, he will raiſe ſtormes againſt a man from the world, diſgraces, and reproaches, and trouble, which are as untimely froſts to nip the buds of goodneſſe. All theſe make the entrance into the wayes of God wondrous diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; but when a man hath entred, and ſpent ſome time in goodneſſe and godlineſſe, and the exerciſes of piety, how ſweet and comfortable doth that way appeare? how joyfull, what inlargement doth a man finde in it? Indeed ſuch that he repents himſelfe that he was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner there. We finde it in <hi>Auſten</hi> when the ſcales were fallen from his eyes, and ſo in <hi>Paul.</hi> And take the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Nichodemus</hi> for all, hee was fearfull at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, hee comes to Chriſt by night, ſome ſay out of ſhame; becauſe hee that was a teacher would not bee thought to learne; ſome ſay out of wiſdome, becauſe the night is the fitteſt time to learne. But the truth is, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> hath it, it was out of feare, fearing the Jewes leſt he ſhould be caſt out of the Synagogue: well, hee that came ſo fearfully by night, he was after ſo bold that he durſt appeare in publicke to ſpeake for Chriſt. So <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> he went boldly to aske the body of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:158707:13"/>Chriſt, and tooke it downe when it was contemned of all the world, and prepared coſtly odour for his buriall.</p>
            <p>The way of Religion is called a yoak, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. and <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith well of it, <hi>Grave cum tollis &amp;c.</hi> It is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous when ye take it up, but after it is borne a while it is ſweet: <hi>My yoake is eaſie, and my burthen is light,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. Saith the Poet, A heifer that is not uſed to the yoake, ſtruggles, the yoake pincheth the necke, but after a while ſhe carries it more gently. Even a new ſuite of cloaths though they be made never ſo fit for a mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it is not ſo eaſie the firſt day as after it is worne a while. Two milſtones, though they be made fit, doe not grinde ſo well at the firſt as afterward. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then man could ſay, Ever chooſe the beſt courſe, and what by cuſtome, and uſe, it will bee made pleaſant. What ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> by way of incouragement to men that enter into the waves of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.12. <hi>When thou art entred thy feet ſhall not be ſtraitned,</hi> that is, thou ſhalt finde more and more inlargement. And it is the ſpeech of <hi>Auſten,</hi> Entertaine the ſervice of the Spirit of God, and thou ſhalt not be ſtraitned, but more inlarged: and he ſpake out of experience: for ſaith he, Before thou didſt come, O God, I complained of ſtraitneſſe; but when thou didſt fill my ſoule, thou didſt exclude not me, but that anxiety, and perplexity that I was in.</p>
            <p>The Uſe of it is this, That ſeeing men are apt to bee diſcouraged in the beginning, and yet finde a great deale of latitude after, and the way more broad; It ſhould teach us in the feare of God, not to be troubled too too much with the difficulties that we meet with in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of good works and buſineſſe, digeſt the difficulty in the threſhold of the buſines; for after it will be more eaſie.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:158707:13"/>
            <p>Saith ſome man, when he is to be converted, and is told what will be requited of him. What! pray ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly: What! heare the word of God ſo exactly: What! mortifie a mans luſts, and bid adieu to his old pleaſures: What! faſt, and abſtain from the uſe of the creatures, and other things that are required; this is a hard ſpeech, who can endure it? O, in the name of God, trie it, put in to the way, my ſoule for thine after thou art entred into it thou ſhalt finde it every day more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. <hi>Moſes,</hi> that was fearfull at the firſt, takes after any buſineſſe without reluctation; ſo ſhalt thou.</p>
            <p>In the way of ſinne there is oft-times a great deale of pleaſure in the entrance, and it may be there may bee a ſeeming ſweetneſſe in the progreſſe; but the further a man goeth, the more perplexities offer themſelves, and then he apprehends the trouble and danger, and what will the reckoning be? It is otherwiſe in goodneſſe, though a man be ſtraitned in the entrance, after he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to good wayes, he begins to be free, and empty and vacant of feares, and ſtill there is more light grows till the perfect day; and that that was burthenſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes lightſome, <hi>That it is his meat and drinke to doe the will of his Father:</hi> he longs after the hearing of the word, and after the time of prayer, and hee is never ſo well as when he is ſo imployed, that he is as nimble in the performance as a man is in carrying one of the jovnts of his body, and there is no man doth that with difficulty.</p>
            <p>O let us labour to have the habit of good, enter into the wayes of God, and make it a cuſtome, let it once be ſo naturall, and we ſhall have joy enough.</p>
            <p>I will not ſay, but that clouds may ſometimes come
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:158707:14"/>between us and our Sunne. What of all that; as they ſaid concerning <hi>Iulian,</hi> It is a cloud that will ſoone paſſe away, and there will be joy and conſolation, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort afterward. As we ſee it is with a man when he goes into the water in a hot ſeaſon, there is a trembling of his body when he firſt puts in; but after he hath drenched himſelfe he is not ſenſible of the cold; ſo the way of piety is irkſome at the firſt, but after it gives great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and contentment.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, <hi>Moſes</hi> may here be an example to all thoſe that God imployes to great perſons, though they be wicked, and prophane, and hard hearted, they ſhould not refuſe to go: If <hi>Samuel</hi> be imployed to <hi>Saul,</hi> if <hi>Elias</hi> to <hi>Ahab;</hi> and if <hi>Ezekiel</hi> goe among briers, and thornes, and ſcorpions, as God tells him in the beginning of that Propheſie. If wee bee ſent to ſow ſeed among ſtones, we muſt be contented with the worke: <hi>For God is able of theſe ſtones to raiſe up children unto Abraham.</hi> Though their hearts be as Adamant, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.12. it may be broken, Adamant is ſaid to be ſo hard that it cannot be broken: But <hi>Plinie</hi> in his Naturall Hiſtory ſaith, that as ſtiffe as it is to indure the fire, and all the blowes, yet it may be broken with goats milke. Beloved, it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the hardeſt heart in the world to be broken, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the blood of him that was ſet out by the Scape-Goat: if he ſprinkle it by our Miniſtery upon any, hee can breake them. If otherwiſe, if men block up their owne way, yet a man that is obedient to the meſſage of God, he hath freed his own ſoul; he is a ſavor, and a good ſavour to God in thoſe that periſh. So I have done with thoſe three things; The obſtinacie of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> The lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganimity of God; And the piety and obedience of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:158707:14"/>
               <hi>Moſes,</hi> who though he were refractory at the firſt, now at the laſt goes on with a great deale of courage.</p>
            <p>I come to the commination laid downe in the ſecond verſe.</p>
            <q>But if thou refuſe to let them goe, I will ſmite all thy borders with frogs.</q>
            <p>God ſpeakes not to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> immediatly, but he will have <hi>Moſes</hi> commend this meſſage to him. And indeed this hath beene Gods manner of dealing, to acquaint his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers with his mind, and they to deliver it to the people he ſends them to. Thus he acquainted <hi>Noah</hi> with what he purpoſed againſt the old world, that he meant to bring a flood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. Thus he acquainted <hi>Abraham</hi> with what he would doe with <hi>Sodome.</hi> Thus he acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Samuel</hi> what he would doe with <hi>Saul,</hi> and the houſe of <hi>Eli.</hi> Thus he told <hi>Elias</hi> what he would do with <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Iezebel,</hi> and their family, and thus he hath dealt in all times. Nay, as it is <hi>Amos</hi> 3.7. <hi>The Lord will do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but he will acquaint his ſervants the Prophets with it. Non quod faciat in Coelo &amp;c.</hi> ſaith <hi>Ierome,</hi> not with every thing that he doth in heaven, but with what he doth upon the face of the earth, God is pleaſed to reveal it to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and they muſt make it known to the ſons of men.</p>
            <p>And this God doth out of reſpect to his ſervants; for they being his favourites, and deare to him, he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates his purpoſe to them. <hi>Shall I hide from Abraham the thing that I doe? Gen.</hi> 18. Why? he was the friend of God; he knew that he would inſtruct his family.</p>
            <p>And then he commends them to others therein, hee ſhews his great prudence and providence that he fits men with meſſengers like themſelves, <hi>Iob</hi> 33.6. ſaith <hi>Elihu,</hi> I am a man like thee, fit for thee, God hath appointed me
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:158707:15"/>to ſpeake &amp;c. We are not able to endure God ſpeaking to us; we ſee it in the Iſraelites, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. We are not able to endure not an Angell to appeare; for it was a cauſe of trouble to them that they appeared to; as we ſee in the father of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and the father of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt. Therefore God hath fitted us by condiſcending to our weakneſſe to ſpeake to us by men.</p>
            <p>Againe, God will make triall of men whether they will receive meſſengers like themſelves, and ſo receive their meſſage; whether they will reject the treaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is brought in a leather purſe; whether we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as the word of man, or as the word of God that is able to ſave our ſoules, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith.</p>
            <p>Hence it is (for the uſe of it) that we denounce to you the judgements of God upon occaſion. The Miniſters now are full of judgements oft-times. How come wee by this? You muſt not ſay to us, as they did to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, You take too much upon you yee ſons of Levi: And who hath knowne Gods mind, or hath been his councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour? Iſay</hi> 45. We arrogate not to our ſelves to know the minde of God; we ſay not as the Prophets that God communicates himſelfe to us as he did to them; we ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre the <hi>enthuſia's</hi> of the Anabaptiſts. But we ſay this, <hi>That revealed things belong to us, and to our children.</hi> God hath puniſhed ſuch ſinnes with ſuch judgements, and ſtill he threatneth the ſame judgements to ſuch iniquities, and we denounce in the name of God ſuch judgements to ſuch ſinnes.</p>
            <p>We that are Miniſters obſerve the ſinnes of this land to grow to a fearfull height, as for quality, for nature, and proportion; they are of the firſt magnitude, and ſo are growne up to heaven. We have obſerved a long
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:158707:15"/>time the pride of the land, not only in diet, but in appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell exceſſive. We have obſerved the Idolatry that is creeping in among us. We have obſerved the unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe in people; the ignorance as darke as hell; the foule luſts, the groſſe exceſſe in men, as if the Devill were entred into a company of ſwine; we have obſerved theſe, and other ſinnes that provoke Gods wrath. And theſe, and the like we have ſeene impenitently commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and we have ſpit in the face of theſe abominations, not only ſeven times, but ſeventy times ſeven times. And now we ſee no reformation, we are bold, in the name of our God, to denounce judgements, and we have told you that plague and famine would come for the ſinnes of the land; and hath the Lord ſuffered one jot of the words of his ſervants to fall? I, and yet we muſt tell you that continuing in your iniquities, will provoke God to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wrath; and we may boldly ſay, If we be deceived, God hath deceived us, and though heaven and earth pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, there is not one word of God ſhall periſh.</p>
            <q>If thou refuſe to let them goe.</q>
            <p>Saith <hi>Toſtatus</hi> upon this place; The common way of men that are ſuppliants to others is to intreat a thing, but never to ſeeme to diſtruſt them that they aske of, and to queſtion it: for though they bee perſwaded that they ſhall be denied, yet they will not intimate ſo much for feare they ſhould be thought to diſtruſt the goodneſſe of the giver. And indeed if a man finde himſelfe diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, though he had a prompt minde to ſatisfie the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, he is ready to fall backe againe.</p>
            <p>But if a man goe ſo farre as to manifeſt his diſtruſt of the performance, yet it is not the faſhion of ſuiters to threaten: therefore ſaith my Author; See in what
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:158707:16"/>manner <hi>Moſes</hi> comes, not in his owne name, but in the name of God, and though he ſpake to one that was above him, yet he ſaith, <hi>Let them goe,</hi> for God will not brooke a refuſall.</p>
            <p>Thus we that are Miniſters, as we call to men for obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and threaten them for their diſobedience; and we ſpeake it out of the dominion, and authority, and power that God hath inveſted us with, we ſpeake it home.</p>
            <p>For the buſineſſe doth not lye between God and his people, as between man and man that are reciprocall, that may be equall; but it is betweene God and his People, as between a King and his Subjects, where there is a wondrous diſproportion. Therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> might ſpeake, and ſpeak imparatively, and with a commination, <hi>If thou refuſe, &amp;c.</hi> But I will not ſtand upon that:</p>
            <q>If thou refuſe to let them goe.</q>
            <p>Hee doth wiſely premiſe this, before hee ſpeake of the judgement, that <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and all the world may take knowledge, that God never puniſheth without a cauſe.</p>
            <q>If thou refuſe to let them goe, I will ſmite thy Country with frogs.</q>
            <p>
               <hi>God forbid that the judge of all the world ſhould deale un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly,</hi> ſaith <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. <hi>ult.</hi> And ſaith the Lord, <hi>When theſe things are done, you ſhall know that I have done juſtly, that what I have done was not without a cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Never did God puniſh any man without a cauſe.</q>
            <p>Was there not cauſe for our firſt parents puniſhment, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that we have heard? they refuſed to heare the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, and to obey it. Was there not cauſe of the puniſhing of <hi>Cain?</hi> Yes, he refuſed to heare God when he ſpake to him fairly to prevent a wickednes. Was
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:158707:16"/>there not cauſe of puniſhing the old World? Yes, they were full of luſts, and of cruelty, and refuſed to heare the Preacher of righteouſneſſe, ſo <hi>Noah</hi> is called. Was there not cauſe of puniſhing Gods people, and of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem?</hi> God, ſaith he, ſent his Prophets early, and late, and they refuſed to heare them. <hi>We have not hearkned to the voice of thy ſervants the Prophets ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlodging the ſins of the people, Dan.</hi> 10. And Chriſt himſelfe when he gives the reaſon of the deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem, He would have gathered them as the hen gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth her chickens under her wing, but they would not.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as St. <hi>Auſten</hi> ſaith, Judgement never knew the way into the world without Sin; Sin uſhered it in: therefore God muſt be juſtified in all things. For the very childe that is new borne, that never committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall iniquity; nay that was prevented in the birth, muſt juſtifie God if it be ſent to hell; for in the rigour of Gods juſtice it is condemned before it be borne.</p>
            <p>Therefore let no man ſay when he is afflicted, as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becah</hi> ſaid, <hi>Why am I thus?</hi> upon the ſtrugling of the twins in her womb: reflect on thy ſelf, and thou ſhalt find cauſe enough of the judgement of God, and greater then thou canſt conceive. It cannot poſſibly be but thou ſhalt finde a cauſe, yet this is a certaine rule, Gods judgements may be ſecret, but they cannot be unjuſt.</p>
            <q>I will ſmite thy land, and all thy borders with frogs.</q>
            <p>Much might be ſaid concerning that party ſmiting; that all the world might know, that none but he hath done it.</p>
            <p>Much might be ſaid concerning that word, <hi>I will ſmite,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, It ſhall not be a ſigne, it ſhall now be a plague, a ſtroake on thee, thou ſhalt be ſenſible of it: I will not now deale with ſignes, but will come nearer
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:158707:17"/>then before: but theſe I paſſe, and come to ſpeake of the judgement.</p>
            <q>I will ſmite thy land with frogs.</q>
            <p>Though it be true that God hath all creatures to ſerve him; He being the Lord of Hoaſts, they are at his beck. The fire comes downe to burne <hi>Sodome.</hi> The water drownes the Egyptians. The earth ſwallowes <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abyram.</hi> The Lion conſumes the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Prophet. The Beares deſtroy 42 children that mocked <hi>Eliſha.</hi> The Serpents ſting the diſobedient in the wilderneſſe. Which by the way, will be a ſhame to man at the laſt day, that all creatures are dutifull to God, and man only rebels. As one ſaid, That beaſts ſhall give evidence at the laſt day againſt man, that they ſerve him, but he doth not ſerve God; to ſhew that they are duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to their maker: but man is refractory, and a rebell.</p>
            <p>But now though God have all creatures at his beck, to command them, and that he can ſend one diſeaſe, and one judgement as well as another; yet here hee ſends <hi>frogs.</hi> And why <hi>frogs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reverend <hi>Calvin</hi> gives two reaſons, why <hi>frogs</hi> rather then any other judgement.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſaith he, <hi>Ignominio cauſa, &amp;c.</hi> He would ſhame <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that proud monſter, that cried out, <hi>Who is the Lord that I ſhould obey him.</hi> The Lord takes downe the pride of him by baſe contemptible creatures. Certainly you muſt needs thinke, that it troubled <hi>Pharaoh</hi> much, and he would ſay with himſelfe, when he ſaw the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>frogs</hi> (that after, God willing, we ſhall ſpeak of) What! if we had been overcome by power: If a for raine Prince had invaded my land, and thruſt me out, it had been ſome honour; but to have my land overrun with
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:158707:17"/>
               <hi>frogs,</hi> that I cannot eat my meat, or lye in my bed with comfort for theſe contemptible creatures, what a vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is it? It muſt needs vex the heart of that proud King. God would take him downe in his inſolencie, by this poore, baſe, contemptible creature.</p>
            <p>Thus God hath done oft-times; he puniſhed the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians afterwards by <hi>lyce,</hi> the pooreſt, and baſeſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all. So, he puniſhed <hi>Herod</hi> by <hi>wormes;</hi> hee that was ſo proud that he entertained the applauſe of the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziticall people, <hi>The voyce of God and not of man.</hi> And we read of a Biſhop in the Eccleſiaſticall ſtory that was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by <hi>rats,</hi> after he had called the poore people <hi>rats</hi> and <hi>mice.</hi> So, that inſolent Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the fourth, our Country-man: God uſed no other thing to take him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but a <hi>flye</hi> to choke him. Poore things God hath to humble great men of the world, and to take downe their pride. This the Apoſtle hath, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.27. <hi>God hath choſen the weake things of the world to confound the mighty, and fooliſh things to confound the wiſe, and baſe and meane things, and things that are not, to bring to nought things that are.</hi> Things that are of no name nor number among the ſonnes of men, God hath choſen to controll the great men of the world, that thinke it an honour to them to fight againſt God.</p>
            <p>You ſee how contemptuouſly and ſcornfully <hi>Goliah</hi> looks on <hi>David, Come, and I will give thy fleſh unto the fowles of the aire, and unto the beaſts of the field.</hi> Yet God ordained that poore ſtripling to ſtrike downe that great monſter; and ſo he did to the honour of God, and to the reſcuing of the glory and Iſrael of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore whenſoever God laies ſhame and diſgrace on us, and puniſheth us by creatures that we contemne
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:158707:18"/>and ſcorne: reflect on the pride of thy heart, that is the reaſon that God hath inflicted it to abate thy pride; the more baſe the puniſhment is, the more is thy pride that God uſeth that to bring thee downe. The more lofty a mans thoughts be, the more baſe ſhall the meanes of his humiliation be.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Calvin</hi> gives another reaſon, why God ſent <hi>frogs,</hi> that <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his people might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that all this while they led their lives, and enjoyed the latitude of their health and livelihood by Gods meer favour. That though they contemned him, or at leaſt did not thinke of him; yet they ſhould know that he was the God of all the world, and that it was he that preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them all the while: for Egypt being a place of a puddle and a ſtanding poole, and <hi>Nylus</hi> but a lake, it was apt to breed <hi>frogs.</hi> And there being ſo much water and innundations, and ſuch ſlime left, it might breed <hi>frogs</hi> in abundance; there might be abundance before: But God reſtrained that fertile Country of <hi>frogs,</hi> ſo that all this while they were not chaſtiſed by this judgement; they might acknowledge that from God they received this immunity. And certainly,</p>
            <q>It is a great mercy for men to be free from the calamity of brute creatures.</q>
            <p>It is a great mercy of God, we muſt acknowledge it his worke and bleſſing, that we are kept free from them. For when man was fallen he did not only make God his enemy, but every creature; that every creature is ready to take the part of God againſt man for ſinne, and would fall upon man to revenge the wrath of God, but only God reſtraines them.</p>
            <p>Therefore you ſhall ſinde among the judgements that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:158707:18"/>God threatneth againſt wicked men, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.21. Hee threatneth them with <hi>be eſts, wilde and noyſome,</hi> that they ſhould come and doe miſchiefe to the people, as well as the <hi>plague, and famine, and ſword.</hi> So we finde it promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as a bleſſing, <hi>Iob</hi> 5.23. <hi>The man that feareth God ſhall be at peace with the beaſts of the field.</hi> And <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.18. <hi>I will make for them a covenant with the beaſts of the field, and with the fowles of the heaven, and with the very cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping things of the earth.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, they will not be at peace with thoſe that are ſinfull, except I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine them, and keep them in, or elſe they will be ſure to ſhew their wrath againſt man for his diſobedience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. It is Gods reſtraining that keeps them in, that elſe would flye upon man for ſinne. The Lion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured not the Aſſe that devoured the Prophet; God would have him goe no further but reſtrained him from killing him, that he was as apt to fall on as the man.</p>
            <p>Therefore, in the dangers that we eſcape from beaſts, and brute creatures, let us give praiſe to God. For as St. <hi>Auſten</hi> ſaid, He thanked God not only for the ſinnes that he had remitted, but thoſe ſinnes that he had kept him from. So I tell thee we are bound to thanke God for privative favours, I meane not only for thoſe afflictions that we are delivered out of; but thoſe croſſes and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities that we are kept from that come not into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of a great number of you, when you have armed all the creatures againſt you by your ſinnes; and yet you go on free, and they doe not that that they would, but God reſtraines them. You thinke it is no mercy.</p>
            <p>But we muſt acknowledge Gods goodneſſe and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that he keeps in the creature that elſe would revenge him, give the glory to God. How oft have you knowne
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:158707:19"/>people, ſome goared with Oxen, ſome killed with Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſome ſtung with Serpents, ſome torne by Dogs. Why hath not all this fallen upon you or me? Is it not Gods mercy?</p>
            <p>That the <hi>frogs</hi> did not doe this to Egypt before, was it not Gods mercy? And that theſe creatures are kept from us, is it not Gods favour? Therefore, if others be ſlaine, and touched, and ſmitten, let us keep a Paſſeover; let us give glory to God, in whom we live, move, and have our being: and let us live to his glory, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his commandements, without whom we cannot live one moment.</p>

            <q>I will ſmite all thy borders with frogs.</q>
            <p>It is well knowne that <hi>Egypt</hi> is a large place, and full of inhabitants. All places and perſons that were in <hi>Egypt</hi> God threatned to ſmite with this judgement, yet you ſhall finde that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was the maine offender; it was he that uſed his power to miſchiefe, to plague Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo as he provoked God to plague all <hi>Egypt:</hi> And my obſervation ſhall be this,</p>
            <q>Multitudes are puniſhed oft-times for one mans ſinne.</q>
            <p>The borders of <hi>Egypt</hi> all of them, all the places and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants were plagued for <hi>Pharaohs</hi> offence. Examples in Scripture are frequent to prove this. <hi>Abimelech</hi> was the faulter, the party that faulted, and behold all the wombes in <hi>Abimelechs</hi> family were ſhut up, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. So in <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 7. <hi>Ay</hi> was beſieged, and ſome were to goe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it: but ſome of the men come out of <hi>Ay</hi> and ſlay 36 of the Iſralites: It troubled <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> and the Elders, <hi>and they fall downe before the Lord,</hi> and he ſatisfies them preſently, <hi>There is an accurſed thing among you,</hi> ſeeke it out or elſe you ſhall not prevaile: So there was one <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> that had ſtollen a <hi>Babyloniſh garment, and a wedge of gold.</hi> Saith <hi>Salvianus,</hi> One mans ſinne, was many mens miſery. <hi>Saul</hi> was the man that ſinned againſt the poore <hi>Gibionites,</hi> you ſee how all <hi>Iſrael</hi> was plagued with three
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:158707:20"/>yeares famine, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. So we finde <hi>David,</hi> whether out of curioſity, or vain-glory, he would needs number the people, yet ſeventy thouſand were ſlaine by the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. <hi>Ionah</hi> was the man that faulted, and all the ſhip, and the people in the ſhip were in danger; and he himſelfe ingeniouſly confeſſed that it was for his ſake that the ſtorme came, and that they ſhould proſper and doe well, if they were disburthened of him. Therefore the heathen could ſay, the whole City muſt ſuffer for one mans ill. And another of them obſerved of the Greeks <hi>unius obnoxa &amp; furia &amp;c.</hi> one mans wickedneſſe, is all mens trouble.</p>
            <p>Now will ſome man ſay (if it may be lawfull to aske the queſtion) what juſtice is there in this, that one man ſhould ſinne, and other folke be puniſhed? will not this juſtifie the cavill of the old Atheiſts, That one man was ſicke, and another tooke the phyſicke? Doth not God ſay in <hi>Ezekiel, The ſoule that ſinneth ſhall dye?</hi> and would he not have that curſed proverb ſuppreſſed, <hi>The fathers have eaten ſoure grapes, and the childrens teeth are ſet on edge?</hi> And doth not St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6, <hi>Every man ſhall beare his owne burthen.</hi> Why then if <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſinne, let <hi>Pharaoh</hi> alone be puniſhed; why ſhould God <hi>ſmite all the borders of Egypt? David</hi> ſaid, when he ſaw the Angell forrage the whole Army, and the people, <hi>What have theſe ſheep done,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.</p>
            <p>Now for the anſwer to this, there muſt be one ground neceſſarily laid in the firſt place, and that is this, That however things appeare to us, God neither is, nor can be unjuſt, as in nothing elſe, ſo not in puniſhing: <hi>God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, that the judge of all the world ſhould be unjuſt, Gen</hi> 18.25. <hi>Is God unrighteous, Rom.</hi> 3.5. <hi>when he executes ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance?</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:158707:21"/>It is true the wayes of God are far beyond out apprehenſion, beyond the poſſibility of our attaining, we may as well empty the Ocean into a cockle ſhell. <hi>The righteouſneſſe of God is a high mountaine; the judgements of God is a great deep, Pſal.</hi> 36. <hi>The well is deepe, and wee have not wherewith to draw, Ioh.</hi> 4. But this is ever cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, though we doe not alway ſee the reaſon, there is a reaſon that we cannot ſee, <hi>That God is righteous in all his wayes, and holy in all his works, Pſal.</hi> 145.17. That is the ground that I lay in generall.</p>
            <p>More particularly now for the anſwer; ſome will ſay, That a King and his People make but one perſon, or one body; therefore it is free for God ſince <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſinned, to plague all <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſince they were his dominion and people; it was free for him for a paine in the head to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a veine in the arme. As men take liberty when the hand is faulty, to put the feet in the ſtockes. But this comes not home ſufficiently; though it may hold in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his people making one body, or in regard of a Maſter and his family that make but one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or of a Father and his childe; becauſe as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith, The childe is part of the parent.</p>
            <p>But how doth it hold when men are in the ſame ranke and condition, and multitudes of them are puniſhed for one mans ſin?</p>
            <p>Therefore to ſalve it fully; know that there is a double impulſive cauſe of puniſhment.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, that that is called <hi>pro</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Not to perplex you with the nycities of the Schooles, theſetwo cauſes differ thus, as the cauſe and the occaſion. To put an inſtance. A man that hath fed full a long time,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:158707:21"/>comes to have a pletory fulneſſe of crude, and raw hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in his ſtomach. It falls out that this party riding after in the wet, taking cold, he begins to ſhiver and ſhake; and after he falls into a durable laſting Feaver. If the Phyſitian be a wiſe and underſtanding man, aske him what was the proper cauſe of this ſickneſſe? and he will tell you the inward ill humours of the body, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding of them: yet it is like enough, that it had not turned to a Feaver ſo ſoone, if he had not tooke cold of his feet, or beene ſome way troubled in his journey. So when God brings puniſhment upon people, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cauſe is in every mans ſelfe. There are perſonall ſins inevery man to make him obnoxious to the curſe of God; yet may the ſinnes of the father, or parent, or neighbour be the occaſion that God will puniſh ſin.</p>
            <p>So that we ſay, the perſonall ſinnes of men, are the primary, internall, antecedent diſpoſitive cauſe of Gods judgements; but the ſinnes of other men, they may bee the externall irritating, exitating cauſe of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for theſe are the tearmes of the Schoole-men.</p>
            <p>And this helpes to ſalve that great queſtion, Why the children are puniſhed for the fathers ſinnes? For God in juſt judgement oft-times gives up the chile to follow the ſteps of the father. There is ſomething in nature: for eſpecially thoſe ſinnes that are ſenſuall, that ſymbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize with the predominant humour in the body, may prove oft as diſeaſes in the body, hereditary.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſometimes example, that workes much <hi>vitius corrumpunt vitia &amp;c.</hi> examples that are ſo neare us often corrupt ſooner, and taint deeper.</p>
            <p>Sometime education may helpe; the father may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct his childe in Idolatry, in the rudiments of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:158707:22"/>and the like. So, many beggars bring up their children to idleneſſe, and theeving.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe the childe be free from the fathers ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity which hee hath committed; yet he hath ſinnes enow of his owne that may juſtly cauſe the wrath of God towards him; yet it may be when he ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in ſuch a time, in ſuch a meaſure, and manner, and other circumſtances, the ſinnes of the father may be the occaſion of the childs puniſhment; the remembrance of that may cauſe God to puniſh him at that time, and with thoſe circumſtances.</p>
            <p>Now for the uſe of this to our ſelves; it lets us ſee, Beloved, (if a multitude may be puniſhed for one mans ſinne) what a miſchiefe a wicked man is to the place he lives in. For as it is with the childe of God, he is a great bleſſing whereſoever he comes, as God ſaid of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Thou ſhalt be a bleſsing, Gen.</hi> 12. So was <hi>Lot,</hi> he was the party that bare the <hi>Sodomites</hi> all the time that he was among them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. So you ſhall finde that had there beene tenne good perſons in all thoſe Cities they had beene ſpared. <hi>The innocent man delivers the Iſland, Iob</hi> 22.30. and reprieves it from the ſentence that is gone out againſt it. <hi>Abab</hi> hath ſo much ſenſe that he thinkes he ſhall be the better by <hi>Ieboſhaphats</hi> accompanying him to the battell. And all the people fared the better for St. <hi>Pauls</hi> going in the ſhip, <hi>Act.</hi> 27. Saith St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> Good men are the wall of the Country, and St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> ſaith, They are the marrow of the Country.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, a wicked man is a plague, and a curſe to the place he lives in; let him be never ſo noble, never ſo honourable, or potent, or wealthy; if he bee a prophase man hee labours to haſten Gods judgements
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:158707:22"/>on the place he is in. We read of one <hi>Byas</hi> the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher that travelling in a ſhip in a tempeſt, with a great number of odd fellowes; ſome of them very rakeſhames and naught; they began in the tempeſt, in that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity (as men will doe) to call upon the gods: he comes to them, and ſaith unto them with ſome jeſt, not in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, ſaith he, Hold your peace, leſt the Gods take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that you are here, and not only you, but we ſuffer for your ſakes. And the Hiſtory ſaith, That <hi>Iohn</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt when he came into the Bath where <hi>Cerinthus</hi> was, he got out preſently; his reaſon was leſt the Bath ſhould fall for that mans ſake.</p>
            <p>Many a wicked man, being challenged for his impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not able to excuſe or juſtifie it any way; yet he hath thus much to ſay; What need you trouble your ſelfe about me, I hurt none but my ſelfe?</p>
            <p>Alas, God knowes, if it were no more, it were too much that a man with <hi>Saul,</hi> ſhould fall upon his owne ſword. <hi>Vtinam vel ſic &amp;c.</hi> as St. <hi>Auſten</hi> ſaith, I would to God it were no more; but if thou be a wicked man, thou hurteſt not only thy ſelfe, but more; (I ſpeake not of thy example ſo much) thou ingageſt the place thou liveſt in to the wrath of God, thou pulleſt it down.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Abell</hi> entertained <hi>Sheba,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. It had like to coſt them all their blood: for if the head of that Traitor had not beene throwne over the wall, the edge of <hi>Ioabs</hi> ſword had fallen upon the whole City. And if the people had not ſeparated themſelves from the Tents of <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> they had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the ſame judgement, <hi>Num.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>Therefore it behoves the children of God nearly to take heed what company they conſort with; not only in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:158707:23"/>regard of ſuſpition, that they may not be ſuſpected to be ſuch as they converſe with; but in regard of infection: for ſinne is as taking as the plague. Thirdly, in regard of the malediction. Therefore in <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. God ſaith, <hi>Come out of her my people, that yee be not partakers of her ſinnes, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a humour in ſome people in the world; if the ſeat be pleaſant, or extraordinary commodious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, they will caſt themſelves into the place though the inhabitants be as full of ſinne as may be. It was the humour of <hi>Lot,</hi> he liked the plaine of <hi>Iordan</hi> well, and thought <hi>Sodome</hi> as the garden of <hi>Eden;</hi> thought he, <hi>My lot is fallen in a good ground,</hi> he looked not to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants: but hee rued it after. So, all thoſe that for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or profit caſt themſelves among the wicked, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they ſhall be ſcorched with thoſe flames that the wicked are apt to kindle where they dwell.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Uſe, ſince God takes occaſion by one mans ſinne to puniſh many, and yet thoſe not without fault; It ſhould teach us to acknowledge when God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth us that it is juſt, and that we our ſelves deſerve it what ever the occaſion be. <hi>Seneca</hi> tells a ſtory of <hi>Piſon</hi> a Roman Generall, he commanded a Souldier to be put to death; becauſe he returned without his fellow that went out with him to the Campe, and ſaid he killed him becauſe hee miſt him. The Captaine that had order to put the fellow to death, eſpying the man comming that was miſſing ſtayed the execution: Therefore <hi>Piſon</hi> put all three to death. What was his reaſon? Saith hee to the firſt, I have condemned you already, I will nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe my judgement. Saith he to the ſecond man you ſhall dye, becauſe of your going away, and expoſing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:158707:23"/>your fellow to death. And to the Centurion, you ſhall dye, becauſe you know not what it is to obey a Generall. So ſaith <hi>Seneca,</hi> he buſied his head to finde ſome cauſe, becauſe there was none. But it need not be ſo with God, he need not buſie his braine to finde cauſe to puniſh any of us that can pretend the greateſt innocency: for our owne thoughts, words, and deeds (God knowes) mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter hourely occaſion and knowledge.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſay, whenſoever it pleaſeth God to lay his hand on us, though another may be the occaſion, yet <hi>juſtifie God in his ſayings, and cleare him when he is judged.</hi> All the difference is but this, as you ſee it is with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of fellons, that have committed robberies in ſeveral places of the County, they are all brought to the ſame Gaol; they are all arraigned at the ſame bar, they all periſh at the ſame tree: ſo God gathers the ſins of men, it may be upon ſome occaſion, and puniſheth them all together; but they have ſins enow of their owne in particular that expoſe them to wrath; therefore let us ever acknowledge that God is juſt.</p>
            <p>I have heard and read of that ſaying of Prince <hi>Henry</hi> in the time of his ſickneſſe, that ſame <hi>delitiae humanae,</hi> as it is ſaid of <hi>Titus</hi> (whoſe death was to this Kingdome as ſo much of the beſt blood let out of the veines of <hi>Iſrael</hi>) when it was told him that the ſinnes of the people cauſed that affliction on him. O no, ſaith he, I have ſins enow of mine owne. So ſhould we all confeſſe, though God take occaſion by another mans ſinne, and by the neglect of another perſon to fire my houſe, yet God hath juſt cauſe to bring it on me. God had cauſe againſt the ſeventy thouſand that dyed of the plague, though <hi>Davids</hi> ſin were the occaſion; yet there was a meritorious cauſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:158707:24"/>in them. So, though <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſinned, yet all theſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians were not without fauſt; for they hated the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralites, and without doubt were glad of the hard meaſure of the people of God; therefore they juſtly ſuffered. Though the hardneſe of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart were the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yet there was cauſe in the people. All the borders and confines of <hi>Egypt</hi> were ſmitten. So much for that.</p>
            <p>The next clauſe is,
<q>The river ſhall bring forth frogs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Marke it well: <hi>The river,</hi> why muſt this abundance of noyſome creatures come out of the <hi>river</hi> rather then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places? God by his word, could have brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite thouſands more then here were; yet God will make the <hi>river</hi> the inſtrument of the vengeance; for two cauſes, ſaith <hi>Theodoret</hi> upon my Text.</p>

            </list>
            <p>Firſt, for the confidence they had in the <hi>river:</hi> for my Authour ſaith, That <hi>Nylum pro Deo &amp;c.</hi> they accounted the river <hi>Nylus</hi> as a God. And indeed <hi>Solynus</hi> in <hi>Plinie,</hi> and others ſay, they afforded divine honour to this <hi>River,</hi> and worſhipped the Crocodiles that were found in it. Certainly they were very proud of it: for in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.3. the Prophet brings <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in thus; he compares him to a Dragon lying in the midſt of the <hi>river;</hi> and ſaying, <hi>The river is mine, I have made it for my ſelfe:</hi> proudly and inſolently. So <hi>Lucan</hi> ſpeakes of it, <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>non indigam, mercis &amp;c. Egypt</hi> needs no commerce with other Nations; it needs not the heavens, they have ſuch confidence in <hi>Nylus</hi> that river. I, in the time of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:158707:24"/>they were ſo proud of their river, and the benefit by the ſame, that they ſtood not to ſay that the plenty and famine of the world, depended on them. And <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> ſaith of one of the Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that he ſaid he thought that neither God nor man could take away his Kingdome. Therefore it was juſt with God to puniſh them in the ſtaffe of their confidence. My obſervation is this; That
<q>In that that a man is moſt troud of, and beares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe moſt on, and is confident in, in that uſually, God ſends his judgement.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I will prove it to you. What confidence had the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtins in <hi>Dagon,</hi> eſpecially after they had ſurpriſed the Arke? they attributed the conqueſt to that Idoll: what ſaid they, Shall any Nation ſtand out now the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is conquered? No: God let them ſleepe in their confidence, but the next morning they may read their folly in the floore. How confident were the Philiſtins of <hi>Goliah;</hi> they outbraved all the hoaſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for that monſter? you ſee what became of them; how God puniſhed them in him. How proud and confident was <hi>Sennacherib</hi> of his Army, as we ſee in the <hi>Kings</hi> and in <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> ſee how God met with him, and debaſed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled him, he ruined 185000. in one night, that in the morning he found he reckoned without his hoſt.</p>
            <p>In experience is it not found that many a man hath been proud of his wealth? <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes of the ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of their wealth, and the ſpite of the proud; ſo hard it is for a man to digeſt his felicity. God hath plagued him in that he hath been proud of; either he hath taken his wealth from him, or him from his wealth. Nay, it may be his eyes have ſeen theeves and robbers take them by violence.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:158707:25"/>
            <p>Another hath beene proud of his dwelling as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtins were of their rocke, God puniſhed them in that, and made their pallace, and habitation a flame over their eares.</p>
            <p>Many men have been proud of their honour, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braved the world for their greatneſſe, as we have ſeen of late: God hath made that to ſinke them, God hath ſo cauſed the people to envy them that their <hi>honour hath been laid in the duſt,</hi> and they have not had common pity. Many have been proud of their wit: God hath made it as <hi>Vriahs</hi> letter the inſtrument of their deſtruction; and their plots have beene their ruine. Many have beene proud of their memory, God hath ſmitten them in that. Many have beene proud of their legges, God hath made them bedred. Many have been proud of their eye-ſight, God hath puniſhed them in that with blindneſſe.</p>
            <p>Many have beene proud of their beauty; ſee how God hath dealt with them: it may be he hath made them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſpirituall temptations; and they have confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, if they had beene leſſe faire, they had beene more ſafe. It may be he hath brought ſome foule diſeaſe on them that hath taken away their feature. Some people have been proud of their children, and doated on them in an extraordinary manner; and that childe that they have moſt loved hath proved the greateſt croſſe. There was the ſootſteps of this in <hi>Iacob</hi> (no doubt but he rued it after.) No man can deny, but that it is lawfull to love him in whom he ſeeth, as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, the greateſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of vertue; yet the expreſſion of it to excite emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the other brethren was not juſtifiable. So <hi>David</hi> doated upon <hi>Adoniah,</hi> he was the childe that rebelled in his old age.</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:158707:25"/>
            <p>There is great reaſon for this: for when the Lord ſees men powre out themſelves upon theſe things of the world; it cannot bee without diminution of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that we owe to him; and he being jealous of his honour, who can wonder if he ſmite them in that thing that riſeth as a rivall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> him? If a man bee ſmitten as <hi>Abſolom</hi> was in his haire, who will wonder if hee were proud of it? If a poore bird come to a bough, and hope for reſt, and finde it ſelfe limed to its undoing; who will wonder at it when things priſed, and loved, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and God neglected, if they prove our ruine?</p>
            <p>Therefore take heed of ſetting your heart and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on the things of the world; and being proud of them: for God will make them ſo farre unſerviceable; he will make them as the reed of <hi>Egypt,</hi> not only to faile, but to runne into your hands and hearts. Whatſoever in the world if thou pride thy ſelfe in it, and prize it too high, looke for a croſſe in it.</p>
            <p>Nay, let me goe further, if it be grace it ſelfe, I would not have thee proud of it, and preſume on it: for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, God can bring a cloud quickly between thee and thy ſunne, and bring thee to thoſe diſtractions, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, that thou ſhalt be puniſhed for thy pride. On the other ſide; if a man love God firſt, and truſt things in, and for him. Firſt, he will be pleaſed with it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it will be a meanes to keepe theſe things to us. Thirdly, if God take them we ſhall digeſt the miſſe of them eaſily: For when God removes them, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely diſtracted: Why? becauſe we were fond in the uſe of them; nay, we make Idols of them. If we would afford God the firſt place, and not pride our ſelves in theſe things, we might have had more comfort, I am ſure leſſe ſorrow.</p>
            <pb n="38" facs="tcp:158707:26"/>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon why this <hi>river</hi> muſt bring forth theſe <hi>frogs,</hi> becauſe of the cruelty they exerciſed in it: So ſaith <hi>Theodoret: Ebulierunt &amp;c.</hi> It abounded with <hi>frogs</hi> even for the poore children that were caſt into it. And the ſame Author ſaith, There was ſome ſutableneſſe betweene the ſinne and the puniſhment: for ſaith he, The poore children that were caſt into it, they were like <hi>frogs;</hi> for the children were not able to ſtand alone, therefore they were faine to goe upon all foure. I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him not upon that. My obſervation ſhall be this; That
<q>In that way, and in theſe things, wherein men have ſhewed cruelty, God puniſheth them uſually.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adonibezek</hi> cut off the thumbs both of the hands and feet of ſeventy Kings, himſelfe was ſo puniſhed (and hee confeſſeth) juſtly, for he had ſerved others ſo, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 1. <hi>Agags</hi> ſword had made many a mother childleſſe, and he was puniſhed by the ſword, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. you may think that <hi>Goliahs</hi> ſword had been bathed in blood, his owne ſword cut off his owne head, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. In the ſame place where <hi>Naboth</hi> was ſtoned to death, the dogges licked the bloud of <hi>Ahab.</hi> So you find that <hi>Haman</hi> upon the ſame Gibbet was executed that was intended for <hi>Mordecai.</hi> The ſame Lions that <hi>Daniel</hi> was thrown unto, conſumed his accuſers. <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells us, That the river, and that falſe bridge that <hi>Maxentius</hi> thought to have trapped <hi>Conſtantine</hi> by, was that upon which his Army ſuncke to the bottome. And the <hi>Tripartite</hi> hiſtory tells us of one <hi>Eutropius,</hi> under <hi>Arcadia</hi> the Emperour, that becauſe he had a minde to puniſh thoſe people that did flye to the Temples; he deſired the King to make a law that none might be priviledged by flying to the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:158707:26"/>and he being obnoxious to the Kings diſpleaſure was ſlaine, though he did flye to the Temple. <hi>Optatut</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> they gave the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> to dogs, and they tore them. <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith of <hi>Caſsius,</hi> hee ſtabbed himſelfe with the dagger with which he had ſtabbed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. And St. <hi>Auſten</hi> obſerves, that in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and and at the Paſſeover, was the deſtruction of the Jewes by <hi>Titus</hi> the ſame time and place, where they crucified Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The Uſe therefore is thus much:</p>
            <p>Firſt, that we abſtaine by this meanes from ſinne; let but a man thinke beforehand, would I be ſerved in ſuch a manner? let me not doe it to another, leſt I look for the ſame ſawce. Would I have another man to violate my bed? why ſhould I be injurious to him? would I bee content to have my children diſobedient hereafter? why ſhould I being a childe, be diſobedient to my parents? would I be content to have theeving ſervants, when I am for my ſelfe? why then ſhould I for the preſent be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull to my Maſter? would I bee content to have dead flyes throwne into my oyntment? why ſhould I ſlander other men in their reputation? would I be content to have my poſſeſſion took from me, or my children by violence? why ſhould I doe ſo to others? we love our ſelves ſo well that we will not ſuffer theſe things: let us take heed of doing them: for Gods word, and experience makes it good, that God uſually payes men in their owne coyne.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place; let it be as an antidote againſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate revenge: doth God puniſh the ſame way? then whenſoever we ſuffer injuries, let us reflect upon our ſelves, whether we have beene wrong doers in the like
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:158707:27"/>kinde or no. And if it be ſo that God doth not only lay judgements on us, but makes them ſo fit, and ſo pat for our old offences; be content and ſubmit to the will of God. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhouldeſt not heare every word they ſervant ſpeakes againſt thee;</hi> It may be thou alſo haſt ſlandered others. As if he ſhould ſay, Be ſatisfied if it be ſo. But if a man reflect on his former courſe and be not guilty, that hee have not done that to others, that hee would not have others doe to him; yet revenge not, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpe not Gods right: for what ſaith the Spirit of God in <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. <hi>They that lead into captivity, ſhall be led into captivity: this is the patience of the Saints.</hi> That is, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the patience of the Saints is exerciſed, that they wait on God till he right their quarrell, that he will doe in his time to his glory, and the confuſion of their adverſaries. Theſe poore Iſraelites, all the time that their children were caſt into the river, they reſiſted not, they freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted their cauſe to God; and you ſee now, though it were long after, God comes, and that very river that choaked theſe children, was made the matter of ſo many <hi>frogs</hi> to infeſt <hi>Egypt;</hi> not only to putrifie the river, but to annoy the Country, and all their borders. So much of that clauſe.</p>
            <p>The next clauſe is,
<q>The river ſhall bring forth frogs abundantly that ſhall goe up or aſcend.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plinie,</hi> in his Naturall hiſtory tells us of two ſorts of <hi>frogs.</hi> There were thoſe that were called <hi>Rubedi,</hi> that have their name, becauſe they live in buſhes, and briers among the brambles. The other ſort were called <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,</hi> becauſe they live among reeds and ſuch things, that uſually have a watry foundation, that grow in the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:158707:27"/>waters. Theſe kinde of <hi>frogs</hi> here, were thoſe that came out of <hi>Nylus,</hi> and ſuch as had the water for their proper element. Yet it is ſaid here, <hi>They ſhall come up:</hi> They ſhall leave their place before that was proper, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to them, and againſt their kinde and nature, come out to dry land to annoy Gods enemies. Whence obſerve
<q>The overruling power that God hath over all creatures, to make them obey his will contrary to their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall inclination, and common courſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is the property of the fire to aſcend; yet the fire deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended upon <hi>Sodome</hi> to conſume them. It is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the fire to burne, yet in obedience to God, hee commanded the fire not to burne; but to the three children it was as a coole arbour to walke in, ſaith <hi>Baſile.</hi> The water it ſelfe is ſo liquid a nature, that it was ſtrange to ſee it contrary to nature to runne upon heapes, to make way for the Iſraelites to paſſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14 <hi>Ioſephus</hi> may talke of the <hi>Pampillians</hi> ſea dividing; he injures the worke of God to compare it with a fabulous diſcourſe. It is contrary to the nature of the waters to runne on heaps, and to be a <hi>wall</hi> as it was then to them. And ſo <hi>Iordan</hi> when the people of God were to paſſe it ranne upon heaps; <hi>What ayled thee, O Iordan, that thou ranneſt backe? The waters ſaw thee, O God, and fled.</hi> It was the overruling power of God.</p>
            <p>So in <hi>Elias,</hi> what a thing above nature, and againſt it was it, that a Raven muſt feed <hi>Eliah?</hi> The Raven is ſuch a creature, as is not indulgent to its owne: nay if God ſhould not provide for them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. <hi>He feeds the young ravens,</hi> ſhe would not regard them. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plinie</hi> both, ſay of her, that ſhe caſts her young out of her neſt, let them ſhift for themſelves if they will; yet
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:158707:28"/>this creature muſt bring <hi>Eliah</hi> meat. That whereas it is ſo ravenous, that it would rather ſnatch from men their meat, then bring them any; yet they muſt doe it, and ſo obey God.</p>
            <p>So, that <hi>Elias</hi> ſhould be carried to heaven in a whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind. They that know the nature of a whirlewind know that it moves not regularly, much leſſe upward; it runnes round in a tumultuous manner. But againſt the nature of it, God makes it carry him up to heaven. So the viper that lighted upon <hi>Pauls</hi> hand, againſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, it hurt him not. What is more naturall for a viper then to bite and ſting? yet it did not hurt him, but he ſhakes it off free, <hi>Act.</hi> 28. So wicked men, what is more naturall then for them to play the beaſts with the children of God? for thoſe are the beaſts that St. <hi>Paul</hi> fought with; yet ſometimes God, contrary to their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, makes them doe good offices to Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Nay, the Devill himſelfe, that roaring Lion; all the world knowes that he deſires to do nothing but miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe; for when he is doing good he findes no reſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. yet God overrules him, and makes him contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his nature to depart and diſpoſſeſſeth him.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of it: Let us firſt tremble at the great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God, and ſtand in awe, and not ſinne. God hath a wonderfull power, he can command all creatures; and whatſoever their naturall inclination be, and we thinke them harmleſſe, God can make them hurtfull, contrary to their common courſe. God is able to bring creatures from the place where their proper element is, to thoſe places where they never were before, to plague his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I would we could learne obedience from
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:158707:28"/>the creatures: they contrary to their natures obey God. It is not ſo with men: for if things runne not in their owne ſtraine, but are contrary to their inclinations, by no meanes they will doe it; let God ſay what he will.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that the yoake of God is ſo heavy: hence it is that the Commandements of God, becauſe they are againſt corrupt nature, are grievous. Hence it is that mortification is ſo ſevere a taske. Hence it is that ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of affliction in a good cauſe is ſo troubleſome, that the fleſh ſaith as <hi>Peter, Maſter be good to thy ſelfe:</hi> but we ſhould remember who hath ſaid, <hi>If you will be my diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, you muſt deny your ſelves.</hi> Nature muſt be ſubdued, and ſuppreſſed, and all the fond reaſons of the ſame, and a man muſt captivate himſelfe in obedience to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
            <p>This blinde obedience is lawfull, as <hi>Abraham followed God, not knowing whither be went. Shall I leave my fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Olive? Shall I leave my ſweetneſſe,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Fig-tree?</hi> Shall I leave all to obey God? Shall I leave my Country as <hi>Abraham</hi> did; and ſacrifice my <hi>Iſaak?</hi> Shall I cut off my hand, and ſacrifice my life, ſo I may be obedient to God? I know nature is ſtrong, it is hard for a man to conquer it: but let me tell you the truth, <hi>Fleſh and bloud cannot enter into heaven:</hi> Therefore all private reſpects muſt be neglected that God may bee obeyed. I haſten to an end.
<q>And they ſhall come up into thine houſe,</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the former Chapter it is ſaid, that when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaw the waters turned into bloud, he returned to his houſe. Marke, how God followes him; God ſaith, <hi>The frogs ſhall come into his houſe.</hi> It is like enough for the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was before inflicted, though it were ſeven
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:158707:29"/>dayes together; hee might have wine and other juyces to quench his thirſt, and he was not ſo ſenſible of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity as the common ſort: but God comes cloſe, hee followes him to his houſe, that would not be warned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
            <q>How hard is it for a man to flye from the judgements of God.</q>
            <p>It is ſo impoſſible for a man to flye from the judgements of God, that the Lord ſaith to <hi>Elia,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17.19. <hi>He that flyeth from the ſword of Hazael, ſhall Iehu ſlay, and he that flyeth from the ſword of Iehu, ſhall Eliſha ſlay.</hi> So a man cannot flye from judgement, if God have marked him for vengeance. In <hi>Iſay</hi> 24.16, 17. ſaith the Lord, <hi>There ſhall be a feare, and a pit, and a ſnare unto you, O ye inhabitants of the earth. He that eſcapes the noyſe of the feare, ſhall fall into the pit; and when he is come out of the pit from the bottome, he ſhall fall into the ſnare.</hi> So here is a ſucceſſion of judgements; a man can never get out if God have marked him for vengeance. So in <hi>Amos</hi> 5.19. The Prophet deſcribes a man hunted out by Gods vengeance thus, <hi>He ſhall be as if he did flye from a Lion, and a Beare met him;</hi> and as if he eſcaped the Beare, and were got to his owne houſe, <hi>he ſhould leane upon the wall, and a Serpent ſhould bite him.</hi> So there is no freedome whereſoever. If he get into his owne houſe, and ſhut the doore, a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in the wall ſhall bite him. So he that flyes ſhall not eſcape, if he flye to the top of <hi>Carmel, and hide him there.</hi> No, though a man goe to the bottome of the Sea and hide him, there is an eye of providence, a Serpent to bite him: there is no flying from the judgements of God. <hi>Adrm</hi> may flye among the buſhes, but God will pull him out to his deſerved puniſhment. <hi>Cain</hi> may flye from
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:158707:29"/>place to place, and build Cities, and thinke to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from being a vagabond, but he muſt be a runnagate. So <hi>Ionah</hi> may flye from the preſence of God, but God hath a meſſenger to diſpatch after him, that was a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, with a ſhrewd meſſage in its mouth. And mark what the Barbarians ſaid of <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 28. <hi>See, though God hath ſuffered him to eſcape the ſea, vengeance hath followed him to the land.</hi> Though a man may eſcape this, and that judgement; he ſhall one time or other be caught: God will follow him to his owne home.</p>
            <p>God hath many hands, therefore a man cannot eſcape him; it is not diſtance that can ſave him; he hath a long hand, and a heavy hand, there is no eſcaping from God; God can diſpatch a meſſage whereſoever a man goes. If <hi>Pharaoh</hi> bee in the field there is bloud; if in the houſe there are <hi>frogs.</hi> I told you of a Biſhop that flouted the poore Chriſtians, and called them <hi>rats;</hi> the <hi>rats</hi> followed him, and at laſt got into his Caſtle in the middeſt of the Sea, and there they ſmote and conſumed him. God will not ſuffer a man to be free, let him uſe all the meanes of ſafety he can.</p>
            <p>Let us make our peace with God; there is no ſecurity but in being reconciled to God Almighty, let us ever ſeeke to him. We have knowne thoſe that have lived out of the favour of God, and in defiance to him in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane courſes; that have proſpered in nothing, venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance hath hunted them, they could be quiet no where. They ſay there is one of the furies called <hi>Ichma</hi> that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes men ſtep by ſtep, and makes every thing unproſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous. Other men have eſcaped from time to time, but God hath found them out at the laſt. As <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is no flight from God Almighty.</hi>

How ever ſome tranſlate the word here <hi>bed,</hi> for ſuch beds as they uſed to eat their meat upon; yet this word ſignifies ſuch beds as men reſt on: and being joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned here with <hi>bed chamber; bed,</hi> and <hi>bed chamber</hi> I make no queſtion, but it was ſuch a <hi>bed</hi> as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> uſed take his reſt on in the night.</p>
            <p>And this aggravates the judgement extreamly: If he might have beene quiet in the night, which is the time that nature hath allotted to reſt; and the time where in a man hopes by reſt, and ſleep to forget the cares and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of the day, and to be refreſhed and comforted; yet God tells him, that theſe creatures ſhall come in this place where he meanes to repoſe himſelfe, and ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbe him where he would take reſt.</p>
            <p>Doe you but judge what a kinde of judgement this was; if the chamber you lye in ſhould be full of <hi>toads</hi> and <hi>frogs,</hi> that you were ſcarce able to ſtep beſides them; that they ſhould continually leap upon your bodies, and upon your beds, as if they would enter into your bodies; for ſo the Jewes thinke that the <hi>frogs</hi> entred into the mouthes of many of them as they ſlept: but I ſtand not upon that. I note and obſerve that God threatneth this diſturbance in the night to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> when he ſhould reſt. It may be obſerved not only that,
<q>Ged is able to puniſh in the night as well as in the day: <hi>But that</hi> God makes his judgements ſo much the more terrible by bringing them in the night.</q> For this circumſtance of time addes wondrouſly to the weight of this judgement. When God would bring that fearfull judgement upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> the laſt and greateſt,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:158707:31"/>that <hi>decimus fluctus,</hi> the tenth wave that was the mightieſt of all other, <hi>The ſlaughter of the firſt bourne;</hi> God did it in the night, in the dead of the night. The text ſaith <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.31. <hi>Pharaoh, and all his ſervants aroſt, and there was acry through the land of Egypt:</hi> for there was <hi>not a houſe where there was not one ſlaine.</hi> O fearfull! a man to bee awaked out of his dead ſleep with ſuch a crie, and ſuch a generall crie; and ſuch a crie for which there was ſuch a cauſe, a generall lamentation of the land of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> himſelfe was not free: this made the wound deep. In 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7. the Aſſyrians were ſlaine in the <hi>night,</hi> for by breake of the day they were all gone; they heard noyſes in the <hi>night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You know if a man be awaked out of his ſleepe with a noyſe of fire, and heare a generall crie in the ſtreet, it amazeth him, and ſends his bloud backe to his heart to nouriſh that, it makes his haire ſtand an end. So it was with them to heare a noyſe of chariots. So when God would aggravate his judgement againſt <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> though all his people went well to their reſt; yet before morning there was ſo many ſlaine: <hi>They were all dead corpſes in the morning. David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.5. ſpeaks of the <hi>terrours of the night.</hi> I will not tell you what they are, they are different and various, as one reckons up a great many of them. Terrours of the night there be, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full affrightings, and therefore the greater, becauſe they are in the night.</p>
            <p>It hath beene the opinion of no meane men of the Church that Chriſt ſhall come at the laſt judgement in the night. <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſaith ſo, more then once; that hee ſhall come in the darke night; and he cites a verſe of the <hi>Sibills</hi> to that purpoſe, Amids the darke night. <hi>Ierome</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:158707:32"/>inclines to this opinion. And <hi>Caſidor</hi> upon the 118. <hi>Pſa.</hi> ſaith, That it was commonly received among the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans that it ſhould be ſo. They build upon the time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the firſt-borne in <hi>Egypt</hi> were ſlaine in the night. And (it may be) becauſe our Bleſſed Saviour was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the night to be brought to judgement, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his laſt judgement ſhall ſeize upon men in the night, and they build it upon the Parable in the Goſpell: <hi>Chriſt ſhall come as a thiefe in the night. And two being in a bed, one ſhall be taken, and the other left.</hi> And ſo of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groomes comming, <hi>There ſhall be a crie at midnight, Mat.</hi> 25. But this is no firme ground, and therefore I dare not ſtand upon it. Certainly Chriſt hath made that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, whether it ſhall be at <hi>evening</hi> or at <hi>midnight,</hi> or at <hi>Cock crowing,</hi> or at the <hi>dawning</hi> of the day, as himſelf ſaith.</p>
            <p>Againe, it is againſt the principles of Nature; for it is not midnight to all the world at one time: for when it is midnight to us, the Sunne to other people is in the verticle point, at noone day. Therfore except the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be at ſeverall times, this will not hold.</p>
            <p>And if we goe by probability, as <hi>Scotus</hi> ſaith, why ſhould we not thinke it ſhall be at that time when Chriſt roſe, that is, in the morning? or when he aſcended; or when hee expired and gave out his laſt breath on the croſſe?</p>
            <p>But it may well be that Chriſt would ſhew us the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of his comming. And I may adde withall (to come to the point I obſerved) to ſhew the terror of his comming to judgement in the <hi>night;</hi> it is more terrible.</p>
            <p>I appeale to any of you that have had an accute Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, if the night hath not more troubled you? The day
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:158707:32"/>is comfortable, the night is unpleaſing; and there are variety of objects, and intercourſe of friends, and talking one with another, that mitigate the paine that a man is deprived of in the night. I will not draw the threed of this loope further, but come to make uſe of it.</p>
            <p>God makes his judgements fearfull to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in his <hi>bed chamber,</hi> in the <hi>night.</hi> Let us night and day feare God. Let us ever know that hee is able to afflict us, not only (as he did them) in our bodies: but as in <hi>Deat.</hi> 28.67. <hi>They ſhall feare</hi> (ſaith the Holy Ghoſt) <hi>and in the evening ſhall ſay, would God it were morning, for the feare that ſhall be upon them.</hi> God is able to bring <hi>frogs</hi> into a mans bed as he did to <hi>Pharaohs</hi> to diſturbe him, faith <hi>Iob: When I ſaid my bed ſhall comfort not, then thou didſt terrifie me, Iob</hi> 7.13. And in verſe 3. he ſpeaks of <hi>weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome nights.</hi> And what ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 77. <hi>In the night ſeaſon my ſore ran and ceaſed not.</hi> The night was a trouble to him as well as the day, and more too, <hi>Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the day is the evill thereof,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. I would God the day were ſufficient for the evill, but even in the night ſeaſon griefes are continued and improved. The ſafe mantle of the night, that covers much wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Thoſe ſonnes of flarkneſſe ruſh upon Chriſt at midnight. Theeves riſe in the night and doe miſchiefe: <hi>Aulus Gellius,</hi> ſaith, They doe their wickedneſſe in the darke. Licentiouſneſſe marcheth in the night. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaw the young man goe to the whore in the darke. <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, <hi>The drunkards watch for the twilight. Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>They that are drunke are drunke in the night.</hi> I confeſſe the times were more modeſt then they are now; for now that fin is become <hi>Daemon meridianus,</hi> a noon day Devill; for men can make indentures in the ſtreets, by the third hour of the day.</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:158707:33"/>
            <p>But now if men would conſider that as they take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſinne in the night, ſo God is able to puniſh them in the night as well as in the day, it would be a meanes to reſtraine them. God is able to make the night more uncomfortable by farre then the day. Hee can take thy reſt from thee that thou ſhalt tumble, and toſſe upon thy bed, and that many nights together till thou grow wild, and ſpeake as frantickly, and as diſtempered as a man in Bedlam. God can make thy bed thy racke; he is able to ſend thee ſuch a diſeaſe as is able to be improved in the night, and thy torment ſhall increaſe. When other men take their repoſe thy paine ſhall keepe thee waking.</p>
            <p>Therefore in the name of God, be fearfull of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him: thinke upon God in the night; thinke thy ſelfe alway in his preſence, and in his eye; not only in the day, when civill honeſty may keepe thee good; but in the night when none but the eye of God looks on thee.</p>
            <p>And that I may not make another point of it becauſe it falls in with this; As thou muſt thinke of God in the <hi>night,</hi> and ſtand in awe of him; let thy <hi>bed-chamber</hi> bee privy to it at all times.</p>
            <p>God plagued <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in his <hi>bed chamber:</hi> It may be becauſe he would ſhew that his judgements can penetrate the greateſt privacie; for the field, and the hall, and the <hi>bed chamber,</hi> and the cloſet, are all one to God.</p>
            <p>It may be alſo in ſome proportion to the ſinne of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh.</hi> I will not ſpeake of his luſt in his <hi>bed-chamber,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have no ground for it; but it is more then probable that in his <hi>bed-chamber</hi> he hammered thoſe cruelties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Iſraelites; therefore God might make this place uncomfortable to him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>bed-chamber</hi> hath been noted to have been guilty
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:158707:33"/>of foule finnes. It was guilty of evill counſell in the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Eliſha</hi> diſcovered it. And in <hi>Mica</hi> 2.1. <hi>There are thoſe that imagine miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe upon their beds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It hath been guilty of licentiouſneſſe, <hi>Reuben</hi> clymbed up to his fathers bed, and ſo alienated his affection. And you know the tricke of <hi>Amnon,</hi> that counterfeited ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. and perſwaded his father to ſend his ſiſter to make him cakes, and ſhe comming to his bed ſide, he drew her and forced her. <hi>Solomon Prov.</hi> 7. ſpeakes of the harlot that had decked her bed, and ſaith to the wilde young man, <hi>Let us take our fill of love till the morning.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> puts <hi>chambring and wantonneſſe</hi> together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>Chambering:</hi> The <hi>Syriack</hi> tranſlate it, uncleane ſleeping places.</p>
            <p>Nay, let me goe further, in the ſtate of matrimony and faire wedlocke, the <hi>bed chamber</hi> may be made a place of ſinne. I may not, I dare not tell you how, leſt when I reprove ſinne I teach it. As wee chalenge the Popiſh Caſuiſts, that have brought ſinne to an Art; by diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring iniquitie, they teach men that that they never min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. This I may be bold to ſay, <hi>That it is a ſhame to ſpeak of the things that are done by ſome men in ſecret, Eph.</hi> 5. It is poſſible for a man to be drunke with the wine of his owne Cellar.</p>
            <p>The <hi>bed-chamber</hi> is guilty of much uncharitableneſſe: for though they have ſo much civility as to draw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves farre enough from the hearing of their family, yet man and wife abuſe one another upon their beds, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull ſpeeches, and ſo ſleep in uncharitableneſſe oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. So alſo it hath been full of ſlandering of others; there is the place of cenſure. Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> was
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:158707:34"/>cautious and wiſe, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.20. when God ſaid, <hi>Curſe not the King in thy bed-chamber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, let mee renew my Exhortation. The <hi>bed-chamber</hi> as private as it is, let it be a ſanctified holy place; and let a man thinke, God may ſmite him there as he did <hi>Pharaoh. Iſhboſheth</hi> was wounded and ſlaine upon his bed, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. And God ſaith, <hi>The ſword ſhall enter into the chamber, Ierem.</hi> 21.14. Let a man thinke, the bed hee goes up to, may be the altar he ſhall be offered on. When he lyes downe to ſleep, he commends himſelfe to his elder brother death; and he may ſleep and ſleep his laſt: let him recommend himſelfe to God. If he have vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie from ſleep that he cannot reſt, let him reflect on his owne wayes, and <hi>examin his heart, and be ſtill;</hi> ſpend the time in prayer to God, that that is his <hi>dormitorie,</hi> may be his <hi>or atorie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely <hi>David</hi> conſidered theſe good thoughts when he made his chamber his chappell, and ſo ſhould every man; Gods judgements ſeize on him there, as we ſee it beſell <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he viſited him in his <hi>bed-chamber.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is like enough that it would not move <hi>Pharaoh</hi> much that his borders were filled with <hi>frogs;</hi> but they muſt come into his <hi>houſe, and into his bed-chamber.</hi> My ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is,
<q>The greateſt Princes in the world if they offend God, are not exempted from judgements.</q> Thy <hi>bed chamber.</hi> It is not the greateſt honour, nor po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie, nor power that can priviledge them from judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.12. Saith <hi>David</hi> there, <hi>God will be terrible to the Princes of the earth.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. <hi>Te ſhall dye as men, and fall as one of the Princes.</hi> We have inſtances e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now of this in Scripture. <hi>Abimelech</hi> ſinned, and was
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:158707:34"/>puniſhed, a great Prince. So <hi>Adonnibezeck.</hi> So likewiſe another <hi>Abimelech</hi> was ſlaine by a piece of a milſtone, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 9. So we read of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Iezebel,</hi> great Princes, mighty in their times. We finde it in <hi>Sennache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib</hi> that came againſt <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> with ſuch as hoaſt, a great Commander. And <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> that walked upon his <hi>Babel,</hi> he had a great and large command; a great latitude of dominions. So in the third <hi>Herod,</hi> and all thoſe perſecuters of the Church, that as wilde Bores of the Wood, laboured to roote out the Vineyard of God.</p>
            <p>Beloved, if there were no more that we did meet with of God making them the objects of his judgements then that they ſicken and dye, it were no great thing. For ſurely they conſiſt of the ſame principles that other infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour perſons doe. When <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Live for ever,</hi> he meant another life; for in regard of his temporall life, he knew he was like his Image; though the head were of <hi>gold,</hi> the feet were of <hi>clay.</hi> Surely as they conſiſt of ſoule and body, as well as others; they have no ſtronger tyes and ligaments to keepe ſoule and body together then meaner men; they have no more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer over their breath then other men; they are ſubject to ſickneſſe and caſualties. But wee ſpeake of them as they are the objects of Gods diſpleaſure. What may be the ground of this, that thoſe who are ſo great in the world, that the Lord ſhould get the conqueſt over them, and make them inſtances of his wrath?</p>
            <p>There may be divers reaſons given of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, their ſinne, and not ſimply their ſinne; but as their perſons are advanced, ſo uſually their ſinnes are of the firſt magnitude. Thoſe that are great ſinne with a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:158707:35"/>high hand, they thinke they may ſinne with priviledge: And they are apt to heare paraſiticall flatterers as <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> had, that what likes them they may doe. As <hi>Iulia</hi> told <hi>Baſhiana,</hi> It was for them to give lawes, and not to take them. Therefore the Lord meets with them to humble the proud, to pull downe theſe arrogant ones, as in <hi>Iob</hi> 40. <hi>He pulls downe the mighty from their ſeat:</hi> As it was with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> here, that was in his ruffe before, <hi>Who is the Lord?</hi> But now hee findes a God higher then hee.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Princes, and great perſons, are uſually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the reproofe of men. As for the Lawes, oft-times they are as cobwebs, the great flyes breake through them: who dares ſay to a Prince, <hi>Thou art wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked?</hi> Nay, one ſaith concerning the Pope, it is not lawfull to ſay, <hi>Why doth he ſo?</hi> Now when they are not within the compaſſe of humane reproofe, God ſtrikes them. In <hi>Levit.</hi> 20. when the people winke at ſuch offences, <hi>Then will I ſet my face againſt him, and cut him off,</hi> ſaith the Lord; he will take the matter into his owne hands.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the puniſhment of great perſons makes more for the glory of God: for the greater the inſtances of Gods judgements be, the more remarkable is his juſtice, the more legible characters are read in the world of his impartiality. Therefore in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.17. it is ſaid concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Pharaoh, I have ſet thee up that I might magnifie my power, and that my name might be knowne to the ends of the earth.</hi> He ſet him up; as he would ſinne, ſo he made him an inſtance remarkable of his diſpleaſure, that all the world might feare and tremble. And indeed it went farre and neare; for the Prieſts of the Philiſtines when they conſulted about the Arke, ſaith, 1 <hi>Samuel</hi> 6.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:158707:35"/>
               <hi>Harden not your hearts as Pharaoh, and the Egyptians did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Uſe of it, it ſhould teach all great ones in the world to be wiſe, to <hi>kiſſe the Sonne laſt he be angry, and ſo they periſh from the right way.</hi> I know they are apt to know their eminency: <hi>Herod</hi> can eaſily entertaine the voyce of the people, <hi>The voyce of a God, and not of a man.</hi> And the ſtomach of the Pope is not ſo ſquemiſh; but he can digeſt that ſpeech, <hi>Thou art another God on earth.</hi> But they ſhall know that if they uſe their power to injuſtice, and doe that that is diſhonourable to the Prince of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Lord of Lords; the hand of God will be upon them, as well as upon the meaneſt ſubject. Nay, the more mighty they are, the more grievouſly they ſhall be afflicted; and though they be Gods before men, yet they are but men before God.</p>
            <p>Let the Lord put them in the ballance, and ſinde them too light, <hi>He will blow them away with the breath of his diſpleaſure.</hi> Certainly, he will get him honour by the confuſion of thoſe that ſtand up in contumacy againſt him. To the greateſt of them all, it may be ſaid, as it is <hi>Heſt.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Thinkeſt thou to eſcape, though thou be in the Kings houſe, more then the reſt of the Iewes?</hi> So may I ſay, If thou be a Monarch of the whole earth, if thou irritate Gods diſpleaſure, thinkeſt thou to eſcape? <hi>I will build my neſt in the mountaines,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Edomite, who ſhall pull me downe? He that ſits in heaven ſhall laugh thee to ſcorne. He bindeth Kings in chaines, and Robles in fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Iron.</hi> He that threw downe <hi>Lucifer</hi> from being a Prince of light, ſo he ſhall ſerve thee.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, it ſhould teach men of inferiour condition, and yet have ſomething to beare themſelves out with in the world. Be not proud, though thou have
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:158707:36"/>wealth, it may be honour above thy brethren; and art as <hi>Saul,</hi> higher by the head then thy fellowes, preſume not too much; thinke not to be free from judgements if thou offend: <hi>For if thou wouldeſt give ten thouſand rams, and a thouſand rivers of oyle; the fruit of thy body, for the ſinne of thy ſoule,</hi> it will not doe. <hi>Riches availe not in the day of wrath, but righteouſneſſe delivereth from death, Prov.</hi> 11.14. Here an under officer, or Sheriffe may bee feed to forbeare the execution of his office; but it is not ſo with the arreſt of God. If God ſay to the rich foole, <hi>This night ſhall they take away thy ſoule:</hi> the <hi>Subpaena</hi> will not be anſwered but with his appearance, if hee would give all his full barnes to be releaſed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is an <hi>item</hi> to all to admire Gods juſtice, and impartiality, and equity; that ſinites the tall Cedars, as well as the low ſhrubs and thiſtles. Should God avenge himſelf upon the common people that are called, <hi>Curſed,</hi> and connive at the ſinnes of Princes, there might bee ſome cauſe of wonder: but when God ſhall puniſh one as well as another, who ſhall dare to ſay, but his wayes are equall?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, ſtand in awe to pleaſe him, if hee puniſh Princes, he will peſants; if he ſmite the high Towers, he will the inferiour. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.8. <hi>I will viſit the Princes, and in the ſame day, I will viſit all that leap upon the threſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.</hi> If I begin with the Princes, I will goe lower, I am no excepter of perſons, I am impartiall; if they ſinne they ſhall be puniſhed. <hi>All before me are as the ſtubble from him that ſitteth on the Throne, to her that grindeth in the mill;</hi> they ſhall taſte of my wrath, they ſhall be ſure to drinke of the cup of my diſpleaſure according to their ſinnes, that doe not repent. So <hi>Samuel</hi> tells the people,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:158707:36"/>
               <hi>If ye doe wickedly, ye and your King ſhall dye,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.25. So much if that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And into the houſes, and on the beds of thy ſervants.</hi> What were theſe <hi>ſervants?</hi> They were either ſuch as attended upon the body of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that were neare to him; or ſuch as were officers of State, to whom the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of publick buſineſſe was committed. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one or the other, it is more then probable they were ſuch as applauded <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in his ill courſes againſt the Hebrewes, out of an inbred hatred againſt the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes; <hi>for every Hebrew was an abomination to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians.</hi> And likewiſe they were ſubſervient to the King in the execution of his wicked deſignes. And now, beloved, you may juſtifie God in his proceedings; that as he puniſheth the Maſter, ſo he puniſheth the ſervants.</p>
            <q>It is juſt with God when men ſerve others in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to puniſh the inſtruments as well as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall. The ſervants as well as Pharaoh.</q>
            <p>In <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. <hi>Abraham</hi> comes to <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court, (another <hi>Pharaoh</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi>) and it ſeemes his wife being beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, he was afraid that injury ſhould be offered him for her, and you know what he put into her mouth; and after it fell out that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his houſe were plagued. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> makes the queſtion, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> tooke the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man into his houſe, Why ſhould his houſhold be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued? why ſhould his ſervants ſuffer? The Father, as he makes, ſo he anſwers the queſtion: let men conſider what went before; how the Princes of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the woman to him; they looked and ſurveyed her excellencie, and commended her to the King. Hee that conſiders this, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> ſhall finde them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that they played the tricke and part of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:158707:37"/>Panders and procurers, baſe people that were ſervile and officious to the luſt of their Prince. So he ſaith, they did further and give their hand to helpe forward the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be committed; therefore ſaith he, they juſtly and deſervedly ſuffered for that fact: ſo being agents and inſtruments of ſatisfying the Kings laſciviouſneſſe, it was juſt with God to wrap and involve them in the ſame judgement.</p>
            <p>There is a lively inſtance in <hi>Iudg.</hi> 9. the men of <hi>Sechem</hi> did further the wicked deſigne of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and lent him money to ſtrengthen him in his uſurpation. Now becauſe they were ſo officious in that wicked way that he was in, it was juſt with God that afterward they were puniſhed, and a fire did breake out of the houſe of <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi> againſt <hi>Sechem,</hi> he ſlew them, and raſed their City, and ſowed it with ſait. As himſelfe afterward was puniſhed, ſo were they that were inſtruments.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Captains with their fifty that attempted to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend <hi>Elija,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1. A man would thinke they came upon a faire meſſage; when the King ſent for them they muſt come. But ſaith <hi>Toſtatus</hi> (for the juſtifying of God) they were Idolatrous; and it is likely they were ſuch people as were at the becke of the King, to ſerve him in baſe ſervices, therefore it was juſt that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Ioab,</hi> you know he ſerved the turne of <hi>David</hi> in ſetting <hi>Vriah</hi> in the front, the time came that his owne blood was ſhed; and though the cauſe be made by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> for the ſlaughter of <hi>Abner,</hi> yet without doubt God put in the murther of <hi>Vriah;</hi> for therein hee ſerved the Kings luſt: for when the deed was done, and he was to give an account, ſaith he, <hi>If the King be angry, tell him
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:158707:37"/>that Vriah is ſlaine;</hi> as if he had ſaid, that will ſalve up all; he thought the King will thinke he is true in the great matter, therefore I will paſſe by the leſſer; that the King might ſee he was officious to him in that.</p>
            <p>So in <hi>Zedechiah,</hi> that he might ſhew his officiouſneſſe to him that he knew hated <hi>Micaiah,</hi> he ſtrikes him upon the face. Was it not juſt with God according to the Propheſie of <hi>Micaiah,</hi> that he ſhould runne into a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to hide himſelfe, and finde no ſecurity?</p>
            <p>So thoſe that were ſo officious to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to throw the three children into the fire, it was juſt with God that the flame ſhould licke them in, and conſume them. St. <hi>Auſten</hi> in one of his Sermons <hi>de tempore,</hi> hath a conceit that thoſe children that called <hi>Eliſha</hi> Bald-pate, were ſet on by their parents; and if it were ſo, it was juſt with God that thoſe that were ſet on by their parents ſhould be puniſhed. So if <hi>Nicephorus</hi> ſay true, it was juſt that <hi>Herodias</hi> daughter ſhould dye as ſhee did; hee ſaith that ſhe ſlipped into the Ice, and the Ice cloſed and cut off her head: Being an inſtrument of ſo foule an act, it was juſt with God that ſhe ſhould ſuffer. It is juſt indeed that the inſtruments ſhould ſuffer as well as the principall upon this ground: For many a wickedneſſe would finde its owne grave, if there were not ſome inſtruments offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for feare, or favour, or gaine, to execute thoſe purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The luſt of <hi>David</hi> might have eaſily beene ſwaged perhaps if his ſervants had not beene ſo ready to fetch <hi>Bathſheba.</hi> And thoſe high Prieſts had not ſo ſoone wreaked their malice upon Chriſt, if <hi>Iudas</hi> had not been ſo ready to betray Chriſt. So that becauſe inſtruments are ſo ready to being forth wickedneſſe, that elſe would periſh, and come to nothing; it is juſt with
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:158707:38"/>God that the inſtruments ſhould ſuffer.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of it. In the name of God let us all fear to ſerve any other whoſoever that hath power over us in regard of ſinne, let them be what they will; if conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tell us it is unlawfull, take heed we ſerve them not in it: For it will not ſerve another day for <hi>Doeg</hi> to ſay, <hi>Saul bid me fall upon thoſe that wore linnen Ephods.</hi> It will not ſerve the Task maſters of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to ſay, <hi>He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned us to lay great burdens upon the Iſraelites.</hi> It will not ſerve <hi>Abſaloms</hi> ſervants to ſay, <hi>Our maſter commanded us to kill Amnon.</hi> It will not ſerve <hi>Herodias</hi> daughter to ſay, <hi>My mother bid me aske Iohn Baptiſts head in a platter.</hi> O no, Beloved, father and mother, and maſter, and Prince, and all, muſt be obeyed <hi>in the Lord,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, and no further. If therefore we ſhall wave God, and his Commandements to ſerve them in ill, we draw upon us judgements in this world, and in the world to come. And how many can you remember, perhaps in your experience, that have curſed the time that ever they were inſtruments to others ſinnes? Some that have beene baſe Panders and procurers in furthering others luſts. Some that have made a trade of wicked wayes, but many times have beene ingenious, in whom there have beene ſome ſeeds of good left, that have curſed the time that ever they officiated for other people in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe.</p>
            <p>Not only out of ſenſe of neglect of thoſe that have imployed them (though that have been juſt with God, and it hath often fallen out that they have beene ſhaken off that have been inſtruments to others; and when they have been troubled in conſcience, they have been ſhaken off as <hi>Iudas</hi> was by the Phariſees, not only thus) but in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:158707:38"/>the apprehenſion of the judgements of God, before whom all muſt appeare; they know that every man muſt ſtand upon his owne bottome; and the maſter ſhall not then anſwer for the ſervant, or the ſervant for the maſter. The ſervant ſhall then looke on his maſter, and behold him that is ingaged in the ſame wickedneſſe; ſaith <hi>Auſten</hi> not as a patron for his cauſe, but as a companion in his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: for it is the ſpeech of old <hi>Ely,</hi> that is truth it ſelfe, <hi>If a man ſin againſt his brother the judge ſhall judge it: but if he ſinne againſt God who ſhall plead for him?</hi> Maſter, and father, and mother, and all to whom thou art tyed by ſtrict relation, that have uſed their power to command thee to ſinne, they cannot keepe thee from judgement then; thou muſt anſwer for thy ſelfe, and <hi>receive according to that thou haſt done, whether it be good or evill.</hi> Therefore I commend to you the reſolution of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> that when his miſtris ſolicited him to evill, he ſaid, <hi>How ſhall I doe this great wickedneſſe and ſinne againſt God?</hi> As if he had ſaid, I may content thee, and thou maieſt thinke that I doe the part of a good ſervant to give thee ſatisfaction in this; but how ſhall I anſwer God, and my conſcience? I may not doe that that I may not doe with the preſervation of my peace, and the ſalvation of my ſoule. So much for that, <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ſervants were puniſhed. I goe on.</p>
            <q>And they ſhall come into thine ovens, and into thy knea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding troughs; or into thy lump of dough:</q>
            <p>For ſo the word ſignifieth, and ſo it is uſed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. The Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint hath it, <hi>into thy paſtrie.</hi> And here there is another aggravation of the judgement, a fearfull one. Before God diſabled this people in regard of their drinke, for he turned their water into blood, that they could not
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:158707:39"/>drinke of the river without noy ſomneſſe and danger too; for blood is no congruous drink for mans body. Before he deprived them of their reſt: for how could they reſt when the <hi>frogs</hi> skipped upon them in their beds, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their chambers, and crept there? So now he diſables them in regard of their diet; that though they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided food, and made it into dough, yet there ſhould be <hi>frogs</hi> in it, and in their <hi>paſtrie,</hi> and in their <hi>troughs;</hi> nay they ſhould goe into their <hi>ovens,</hi> to conſume, at leaſt to defile. As <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſaith, every thing, bread and meat had <hi>frogs.</hi> Nay in their drinke too, they did not only eat, but drinke <hi>frogs.</hi> Nothing but filth, and noyſomnes, there was nothing to invite them to eating but defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So now ſee here a fearfull aggravation. Thirſt before had like to have killed them, and want of reſt, and now want of food; as if God meant to ſterve them. Obſerve, I beſeech you,
<q>How able God is for the ſinnes of men to diſable thoſe <hi>Pulchra natura,</hi> thoſe common ſupports, and ſtayes of humane nature.</q> He can prevent us in taking food, though it be ready; he can ſend ſuch judgements in it that we ſhall not bee able to take it: if we provoke God there ſhall be <hi>frogs</hi> in our <hi>dough,</hi> and in our diſh, that that ſhall make us juſtly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſte it, that we ſhall be afraid to eat it. That the Lord threatneth in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. <hi>You ſhall be plagued in your basket, and in your ſtore, in your dough.</hi> In thoſe things that are ſerviceable for ſuſtentation. Sometimes God makes things that they are not eatable, though of themſelves they be provided for nouriſhment. Sometimes, though of themſelves they be eatable, yet there ſhall come a loathing and faſtidiouſneſſe upon the ſight of it. And
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:158707:39"/>when it is taken into the body, God ſometimes reſtrains the worke, and operation of it that it ſhall not nouriſh. For as in the creation God infuſed a quality and faculty into the creature; ſo in the exerciſe of it, God is able to diſpend them. If God inlarge not himſelf, and give a word of bleſſing, thoſe creatures will not doe that that we would have them. It is admirable to thinke how many wayes the Lord can prevent the uſe of the creature that that ſhould ſuſtain us in the way of food.</p>
            <p>Sometimes he prevents men from having food by unſeaſonable weather that they cannot ſow their ſeed.</p>
            <p>Sometimes if they ſow their ſeed, God ſuffers it to rot under the clods that it comes not up.</p>
            <p>If it come up, and be in the blade, God ſmites it with mildew, and nips it with untimely froſts. If it be in the eare, God hath other judgements for it. If the time of reaping come, the weather may be ſo unſeaſonable that it cannot be got in. If it be carried into the barne, God can make it mould in the mow. If it be threſhed in the floore, God hath judgements for it there. If it be ground in the Mill, and brought to be bread (as it was here) the <hi>frogs</hi> ſhall be in the <hi>trough,</hi> that they cannot eat their bread unleſſe they will eat <hi>frogs</hi> with their <hi>dough.</hi> Nay further, if it be baked, and taken into the bodies of men, yet God reſerves the power of making it nouriſhable to himſelfe, It is he that gives the ſtaffe of bread; bread is the ſtaffe of our ſtrength: but bread it hath a ſtaffe, that is the word of Gods bleſſing; as Chriſt ſaith to Satan, <hi>Man liveth not by bread alone, but by every word that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi> That is it that gives it ſoule, and life, and makes it nouriſhable. If God reſtrain this, <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ſeven leane kine may eat up the ſeven fat
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:158707:40"/>ones, and not be the fatter. As a man that hath the <hi>Boule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> a dog-like appetite, he may eat, and eat, and is not the fatter. As one in the Poet, that the more he eat, the more he might. Gods bleſſing upon food, that muſt be taken in to make it beneficiall.</p>
            <p>To make uſe of this: you ſee God prevented them, though they had <hi>dough,</hi> and proviſion they cannot eat it. God hath this power over the creatures to prevent us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, or elſe in making uſe of it.</p>
            <p>What is the reaſon that we firſt aske leave for the uſe of Gods creatures, and beg a bleſſing? There is great reaſon that when we come to take the creatures of God we ſhould call upon him, and invocate his name for a bleſſing, that he would ſanctifie them: for if it bee the proviſion of the King, ſuch as was for the captive chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, it will not nouriſh without Gods bleſſing.</p>
            <p>This hath beene the practice of holy people in all times. <hi>Samuel</hi> bleſſed for the people; they did not eat till he had bleſſed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.13. So it was with our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord himſelfe, he never eat before he gave thankes; and <hi>Paul</hi> in a great tempeſt at ſea, <hi>Act.</hi> 27. hee brings them together, and defires them to take meat, but they did not touch it before he gave thankes. <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith, that the Heathen did it. And the Turkes now are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of giving thanks. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apologie for the Chriſtians, ſhewing the courſe that Chriſtians uſed in their feaſts, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ting of their meat; they never ſate downe to the table before prayer was made to God that he would ſanctifie the creatures.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as it is meet that we ſhould aske Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; ſo when we have found that they nouriſh us, and our ſpirits are refreſhed and enlivened, and quickned by
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:158707:40"/>them, and we are made more nimble, and agile for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; then we have reaſon to give God thankes, to returne thankes. <hi>When thou haſt eaten, and art full, remember</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi>) <hi>the Lord thy God; thou ſhalt bleſſe him, Deut.</hi> 8.12. And as it is ſaid of Chriſt, after they had eaten their ſupper, they ſang a Pſalme before they went out of the roome, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. And <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſpeakes of ſome people that were wont as ſoone as ever they had done ſupper or dinner, to turne themſelves upon their knees to give God thankes. The Phariſees were ſo ſtrict this way, when a Phariſee had forgot to give God thanks at table, though he were in the field, he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the place where he had eaten to doe it.</p>
            <p>And he is no leſſe then an Atheiſt that habitually o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the giving of thanks to God. I will not ſay, but a man may forget it, and againſt his purpoſe; but if it be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall to ſit downe, and riſe without giving thanks, he is a brute beaſt; and let him looke, and he may expect the next time he eats to have a <hi>frog</hi> in his diſh, that is, to have ſome judgement. For the Lord will not indure ſuch wretches.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, ſince ſinne lets the judgements of God looſe, eſpecially in this particular of reſtraining a bleſſing upon the creatures. Take heed of groſſe ſinnes; thoſe that the Father calls fearfull preſſures, ſuch as waſte conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſo provoke God not only to cut us ſhort in that which is ſuperfluous, but to maime us, and lame us in neceſſaries; in food that is the ſupport of this taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, without which it cannot ſtand, more then the lampe can continue without the ſupply of oyle.</p>
            <p>And becauſe it may be the wickedneſſe of this people in gluttony of meat cauſed this judgement upon them;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:158707:41"/>for they were given to that; and becauſe in experience God reſtraines men of their meat for that; take heed of gluttony. I confeſſe at this day intemperance in drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe is now more then that of eating, and the more generall ſinne; but intemperance of eating is of too great a breadth, and as great a ſin as the other. And judge you now how many thouſands there bee in the world, that eat above their meanes and ability. Though they pinch their backs their dainty tooth muſt be ſatisfied. I read of old that they were wont to feaſt openly in the ſtreets. If it were ſo with us, there would be many ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to ſpend that that they had reaſon to ſpare.</p>
            <p>Againe, how many thouſands are there, that though they eat not above their ability, yet above their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and calling? for nothing will pleaſe them but rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſuch as are congruous for Kings, meane men muſt have. All their pretence is, they are able to doe it, what of that? I tell thee, and I tell thee as a Miniſter of God, that the rule of our apparrell, and our meat, it is not our ability, but next to Gods word; it muſt be thy calling, and eſtate thou art in: That is not lawfull for a meane man, that is for a noble man; this would bring attaxie and confuſion into the world, and blend thoſe things that God hath digeſted ſo ſweetly.</p>
            <p>Againe, for the manner, how many thouſands eat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly? I meane are content to eat well, and to lye ſoft, and in the meane time never pay their debts? They are ſo far from that that the Apoſtle ſpeakes of eating their owne bread, that other mens goods muſt furniſh their tables.</p>
            <p>How many eat unſeaſonably? That is, when the Church is under perſecution, and judgements are upon
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:158707:41"/>them, and the places they are in, they are moſt prone to feaſt; a fearfull ſinne, God ſaid it ſhould <hi>not be purged from ſome till they dyed, Iſay</hi> 22.</p>
            <p>How many eat uncharitably? without reſpect to the poore; <hi>That ſtretch themſelves upon their beds of Ivory, and are not touched with the afflictions of Ioſeph.</hi> So the rich man in the Goſpell, <hi>he fared deliciouſly every day,</hi> and did not reſpect the poor man at his gate, though he asked but a crum.</p>
            <p>How many eat immoderately? I may ſay as <hi>Auſten</hi> ſaith of them, <hi>They eat not daily bread;</hi> but as much at one time as is fit for them for three or foure meales, what a fearfull thing is this?</p>
            <p>Nay, Beloved, how many are there in the world that eat impiouſly? that not only diſable themſelves from the workes of their ordinary calling; but from the performance of any act of Religion towards God; as if there were no God to ſerve but their bellies. They are farre from the practice of the Primitive Chriſtians, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith in the former place, that did alway eat ſo as that they remembred that God was to be worſhipped. They would not for all the world indiſpoſe themſelves in regard of thoſe holy performances.</p>
            <p>Is there any of you that heare me, that can deny this to be a truth? I know you confeſſe it is a truth; I know your righteous ſoules grieve that there is ſuch juſt cauſe of complaint; and I know you feare the harveſt that this feed will bring out. What was the ſin of the old world? was not this one among the reſt? <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. they ate and dranke as brute beaſts; and did not God bring a deluge upon them? What was the ſinne of <hi>Sodome?</hi> was not one of them fulneſſe of bread? and did not God bring
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:158707:42"/>a fiery ſhowre from heaven and burne them? What was the ſinne of <hi>Eſau?</hi> was it not gluttony, when for a morſell of meat he ſold his birthright; and ſo after was deprived of the bleſſing? he was prophane, as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. And what was the ſinne of the Iſraelites? among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers this, <hi>they luſted,</hi> and were gluttons, therefore when the meat was in their month, <hi>wrath fell on them.</hi> And doth not wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> threaten men that are gluttons in their diet, as well as thoſe that are drunkards, that they ſhall come to rags and poverty? All this is true.</p>
            <p>And what, do we thinke to gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thiſtles? or are we conceited as ſome that <hi>Auſten</hi> ſpeaks of in his time, that God puniſhed the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of <hi>Troy,</hi> but loved thoſe of <hi>Rome?</hi> That God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the diſtempers of former times, but will not now? That there ſhall be no <hi>fregs</hi> in our diſhes, though <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> had them? Is not he the ſame God? and our ſinnes as foule as theirs? and doe they not provoke God to wrath? Wee have found it by ſome experience, if we goe backe a little way. What ſpued out thoſe Abbey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubbers, but gluttony? What hath beene the ruine of many great families, but this? What was the cauſe that God puniſhed us the laſt yeare with famine? Many ſins we have, but I cannot aſcribe it to any more properly, then to gluttony; God puniſheth ſuch licentiouſneſſe with penury, and ſcarcity. And if we goe on, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God as we have hitherto; God will plague us in our <hi>basket,</hi> and in our ſtore, and that that before was but a rod, he can whip us with <hi>ſcorpions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God be thanked, though we had it deare, we had it for money; but God will cauſe the earth to denie her ſtrength that it ſhall not be to be had; &amp; then we may eat
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:158707:42"/>our fleſh for bread, and our bowells ſhall ſound as a ſhalme. And this may be the cauſe of the plague, for famine and the plague goe together.</p>
            <p>Thus the Lord can curſe us in our <hi>basket</hi> and in our <hi>ſtore,</hi> and ſend <hi>frogs</hi> into our <hi>kneading troughs,</hi> and into our <hi>chambers.</hi> Therefore in the fear of God, let us be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of our former intemperance, and let us now labour to honour God. I bridle not men up to neceſſity only; Religion gives a faire way as any reaſonable man in the world can deſire: but take heed that we diſhonour not God, abuſe them not; if we doe, penury will be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of abuſed plenty.</p>

            <p>And for their feeling, that certainly was exerciſed, for not only he, but <hi>Toſtatus</hi> upon the place, ſaith, That many of theſe <hi>frogs</hi> were poyſonfull, ſuch as we call <hi>toads,</hi> and they afflicted, and oppreſſed the Egyptians when they lighted on them. But I ſtand not upon this, but content my ſelfe with the words of the Text:
<q>They ſhall come up, and crawle upon thee, and upon thy ſervants.</q> So that thou ſhalt not rid thy ſelfe of this annoyance, What! in their meat, and drinke, and upon their bodies! Then obſerve with me, Beloved:
<q>God can lay judgements upon people, that ſhall not be more painfull, and troubleſome, then odious, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and noyſome.</q> This you ſhall ſee in ſundry reſpects: That of <hi>Iob, Iob</hi> 7.5. he complaines that his skin was broken, and he was become <hi>loathſome.</hi> I will not follow <hi>Pineds</hi> the Jeſuit, that reckons up ſcores of diſeaſes that this poore man was afflicted with, and all of them as the Phyſitian ſpeakes, of the worſt kinde and quality. The Scripture ſaith enough, and tells us, that he was ſtricken with <hi>boyles from the top of the head, to the ſole of the foot;</hi> and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:158707:44"/>was faine to retire himſelfe from the company of men, and to ſit upon a heap of aſhes, that they might receive the corruption from his wounds, and to get a piece of a potſheard to ſcrape himſelfe with, <hi>Iob</hi> 2.7.8. Such a noyſome diſeaſe had <hi>David</hi> whatſoever it was as hee complaines, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.7. <hi>Thou haſt filled my loynes with a loathſome diſeaſe.</hi> The Septuagint and the Latine tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion read it, Thou haſt filled my loynes with deluſion, and <hi>mocking;</hi> but the Chalde paraphraſe renders it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Thou haſt filled me with burning paine, and noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: So the Hebrew word there uſed will beare it out, which comes from a word to roaſt a thing, and it ſignifies to be made vile. So that it ſeems it was a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning furious diſeaſe, and that alſo that made him odious, and loathſome to the people, and to himſelfe a burthen.</p>
            <p>What a loathſome judgement did the Lord ſend upon <hi>Iehoram,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. <hi>ult.</hi> by which he rotted as it were piece-meale! he was wondrouſly afflicted, and troubled, and tormented; and the Text ſaith there, <hi>Ragelat bele Kemdar,</hi> he departed without being deſired. Some underſtand it, he was ſo wicked that every body deſired his death, he went away, and was not miſſed, every one was glad: But it may be underſtood alſo, he was ſo loathſome by his diſeaſe, that people were-glad he was gone, he was ſo troubleſome, and he tooke no pleaſure in himſelfe by the noyſomeneſſe of his diſeaſe. In 2 <hi>Macab.</hi> 9.9. we read of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> a great perſecuter of Gods people; God ſmote him with a loathſome, noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome judgement, having received a bruiſe by a fall from his chariot; for very torment and paine (ſaith the Text) <hi>his fleſh fell piece meale from him;</hi> and the ſtench of him was grievous to the whole Army; every
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:158707:44"/>one wiſhed him gone, he was ſuch a trouble to them.</p>
            <p>And was it not a noyſome, loathſome judgement that was ſent upon <hi>Herod,</hi> to be <hi>eaten up of wormes? Act.</hi> 12.23. <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſaith, That the Great <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Askalonite,</hi> was eaten up of wormes alſo. But after him it is certaine that <hi>Maximinus,</hi> as <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells us, had a fearfull, loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome diſeaſe upon him, and he ſent out a filthy ſmell; he ſaith he was a fearfull ſpectacle to looke upon. Nay, the very Phyſitians, ſaith the Story, that came neare him, were killed with the ſtench of his infirmity.</p>
            <p>So we read of <hi>Scilla,</hi> that he had a loathſome fearfull judgement ſent upon him. And <hi>Pliny</hi> in his Naturall hiſtory ſaith, that he died a more grievous death then ever he inflicted upon any other. And was it not an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, loathſome judgement that was ſent upon <hi>Arrius</hi> that ſcoured out his bowells upon the ſtoole. So <hi>Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grius</hi> ſpeakes of <hi>Montanus,</hi> that he had his tongue rotted in his mouth, and he dyed miſerably. I could reckon more examples, but theſe are ſufficient in the proofe of this.</p>
            <p>I would not be miſtaken, becauſe I gathered this from Gods judgement upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in ſending the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome <hi>frogs.</hi> I would not have it thought that every one that hath a loathſome diſeaſe is like <hi>Pharach,</hi> that he muſt of neceſſity be prophane and wicked: For in the examples before recited, we may finde <hi>David</hi> had a loathſome diſeaſe, yet he was a man after Gods owne heart. <hi>Iob</hi> had a fearfull diſeaſe, he was full of blaines, and ſores, and boyles, yet God gave him a great teſtimony for his piety and juſtice, above all the men of the Eaſt. I could adde <hi>Lazarus</hi> that was highly in the favour of God, yet he was full of ſores. And certainly <hi>Solomen</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:158707:45"/>
               <hi>All theſe ſhall fall alike to good, and badmen,</hi> we cannot determine of affection, or diſaffection; I meane of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall love or hatred of God by theſe outward things. Though the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> goe too farre; for he makes the end and calamities that light upon oppoſers of the truth, to be a neceſſary argument of the Church; a true note of it. To that purpoſe, he reckons ſtrange judgements to fall on <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> fearfull loathſome diſeaſes. So upon <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Oecolampa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius;</hi> that he hath from <hi>Balſicke</hi> and others, that have not more lines then lies, rayling <hi>Pharaoh</hi> like. We could anſwer them in their own weapons if we were diſpoſed, and tell them of ſome Popes. One ſaith of <hi>Boniface</hi> the ſeventh, that he ended his life very filthily. And <hi>Iohn Stella</hi> ſaith of <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, he entred as a Fox, he reigned like a Lion, and dyed as a Dog. We could tell them of <hi>Iohn</hi> thirteenth, and ſome ſay the fourteenth, that was ſlaine in the act of adultery by the immediate hand of God. And of <hi>Alexius</hi> that dyed by the ſame potion of poyſon he had provided for another. Of <hi>Dreſentius, Leotomus, Nehotman,</hi> and other perſecuters that had fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ends. We ſtand not upon this, becauſe there is no argument convincing to be drawne from the calamity of a man to ſhew his goodneſſe or badneſſe. But that that I intend is, that God oft-times ſends not only trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, but noyſome judgements; as we ſee here upon <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The uſe of it, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. <hi>Standin awe and ſinne not.</hi> God is the ſame God, <hi>His hand is not ſhortned.</hi> He can inflict a judgement upon thee whoſoever thou art, that beſides the paine of it, ſhall make thee abhorre thy ſuſtenance. The very ſmell, nay the ſight of it; nay
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:158707:45"/>the hearing and ſound of it: And not only ſo, but he can make thee ſo loathſome, that even people that ſhould tender their attendance ſhall be afraid to come near thee. How loathſome a diſeaſe is that, even that is ordinary, the ſmall pox in the extremity? And for that other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe that carries the name, that a man ſhould not mention without horror and loathing, what a loathſome diſeaſe it is, and how odious it makes people! thoſe that are of honeſt and faire condition are afraid to eat or drinke with them. So, I have knowne ſome that have been afflicted with ſores, and boyles, and ruptures, that they have been a griefe to others, and a burthen to themſelves. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, <hi>Stand in awe and feare;</hi> for the Lord can doe what he hath done: he can ſet ravenous beaſts on us to teare us; he can make <hi>frogs</hi> and <hi>toads</hi> crawle on us; hee can make fiery diſeaſes poſſeſſe us; he can bring it home to us in a fearfull way if we rebell. Therefore let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſerve him, and to doe him honour, and evermore to praiſe him, not only in word but in worke for feare of an uncomfortable blow: <hi>For it is a fearfull thing to fall into the hands of God.</hi> So much for that.</p>
            <q>They ſhall come upon thee, and upon thy ſervants, and upon all thy people.</q>
            <p>Now this judgement was denounced; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> might have conceived a thought, the <hi>frogs</hi> ſhall come upon me, but I have ſomewhat to helpe my ſelfe by; my people, and my ſervants about me, I hope will keepe my perſon free. The Lord takes away that poore hold, and diſableth him in that he thought of; they ſhall not only be upon himſelfe, but upon his ſervants; that they ſhould be ſo far from from helping him, that they ſhould not helpe themſelves. The obſervation is; that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:158707:46"/>
               <q>When God ſmites to ſome purpoſe he can make a man helpleſſe that all ſuccour in the world ſhall faile.</q> Let him caſt upon what hope he will, and nouriſh expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of this, and that help; when adverſity comes, the judgement of God ſhall have a full blow.</p>
            <p>We have read of ſome famines wherein one neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour hath not beene able to helpe another, all of them have beene ſo generally troubled by that fearfull cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and vexed by it, that a man could not give his neighbour bread without being unnaturall to himſelfe, and unmercifull to his family. When the Sword hath forradged a place, the party that ſhould ſecure his wife and children hath beene wounded, and not able to helpe them. And ſo in regard of the plague, when it hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into ſome families, and allowed no quarter at all, but hath ſtricken all downe that not one hath beene able to helpe another: God hath ſtricken ſome men with ſuch diſeaſes that the whole Colledge of Phyſitians were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver able to give them a minute of eaſe. Nay, it may be the Phyſitian himſelfe hath beene ſo ſmitten that he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as much helpe as his patient. This is ordinary: I will not ſtand further upon the proofe.</p>
            <p>The Uſe concernes us a little; that is, that we never caſt our ſelves upon any earthly helpes without God, let them ſeeme as firme as they will, and able to ſuſtaine us; let us never caſt our ſelves on them without God; they will prove as clouds without raine, as wells without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; they will prove miſerable comforters. They will be to us as the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was to the woman in the ſiege of <hi>Samaria,</hi> when ſhe complayned of the fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the famine: <hi>O</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if God doe not help, how ſhall I help?</hi> Let the Philiſtins truſt in <hi>Goliah,</hi> when the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:158707:46"/>time comes he ſhall not be able to ſave himſelfe. Let them delight in Dagon, he ſhall be ſo far from ſecuting them, that he ſhall be broken in peeces by a fall before the Arke. The high Prieſts tell the Souldiers, if they will tell a lie for them, and officiate in that kinde for them, they will beare them harmleſſe; the day of affliction will come, that they ſhall not be able to helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Nay, <hi>David</hi> diſableth the very truſt in Princes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146. <hi>Truſt not in Princes, or any ſon of man, for vaine is their helpe. Iſay</hi> 20. the three laſt verſes. It ſeemes the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were confident, when they had an adverſay came, and threatned them with the Babylonian forces, they ſent to the Ethiopians for helpe; they did not greatly care what that great man could doe. Saith the Lord, <hi>Goe and tell them the King of Caldea ſhall take Egypt priſoner, and the Ethiopian captive; ſo they ſhall be aſhamed of Ethiopia their rejoycing, and Egypt their glory.</hi> And then they ſhall ſay, <hi>Loe this was our expectation, and how ſhall we eſcape?</hi> As if they had ſaid, theſe people are not able to helpe themſelves; they are made a prey to the devourer, and how ſhall they be able to ſecure us.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſay againe, Take heed of truſting in the arme of fleſh. We are but too apt to doe it. We think if ſuch an adverſary ſhould come, we would doe this; and that this friend, and that money, and policie ſhall doe us good; and when the time of calamity comes, we are as men that put into a Bay in a tempeſt; we think we are ſafe, and before we are aware, we are upon a rocke; and they finde not a haven, and a faire ſtation; but mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of woe and lamentation.</p>
            <p>There be certaine helpes in the world, ſaith a Father, by which we are more weakned then confirmed; that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:158707:47"/>prove as the reed of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And to preſſe it on; then we muſt not caſt our ſelves upon vaine hopes of another world. If in judgements temporall, God can diſable a mans friends and acquaintance; and his owne thoughts perhaps ſhall not relieve him, but he ſhall have a diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed conſcience; what ſhall he doe when he appeares before the tribunall of God? Let him then call to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or mother, or friends, he ſhall ſtand naked before that judgement; and whatſoever plea he hath before thought of to ſubterfuge the judgement, they ſhall be as fig leaves, they ſhall not cure or cover him.</p>
            <p>Therefore get Gods protection by well-doing, and get into his favour by a godly life; and then though fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and friends forſake thee, he will take thee up, and be a ſure protection to his people in the time of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. So much for that.</p>
            <p>There is a further aggravation of this judgement; that is, from the newneſſe and the ſtrangeneſſe of it. Though I finde in ſtories that this judgement of <hi>frogs</hi> was after inflicted upon the world. As <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us of a Towne that was unpeopled in <hi>France</hi> formerly by <hi>frogs:</hi> And <hi>Paulus Oroſius</hi> ſaith, that the people of the City <hi>Abdera</hi> were ſo moleſted by <hi>frogs,</hi> that they were faine to intreat <hi>Caſſander</hi> the King of <hi>Maceden</hi> to get them another place to inhabit. And <hi>Athenius</hi> tells us a ſtrange ſtory like this: he ſaith, in <hi>Onia,</hi> in <hi>Barbania,</hi> there fell a raine of <hi>frogs,</hi> and filled the high wayes ſo abundantly, that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could not ſtep beſides them; and for a time they ſhut their doores that they might be quiet, but it would not doe, the <hi>frogs</hi> came into their <hi>baking troughs,</hi> into their meat and drinke, and moleſted and infeſted every part. And not only ſo; but they crawled upon their
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:158707:47"/>bodies, and were ſo noxious to them, that they determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to leave their Countrie. Now I ſay though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God ſent his judgement, yet for ought I know, this judgement of <hi>frogs</hi> was the firſt that ever was laid upon the world in that kinde. And this added to the terrour of it: For to ſuffer new terrours is a great aggravation of any judgement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſay</hi> 64.4. <hi>When thou diddeſt terrible things that wee looked not for, then thou cameſt downe.</hi> They were terrible things indeed, that they never looked for, or dreamed of, or heard of in former times, thoſe terrible things. So in <hi>Micah</hi> 5.15. The Lord ſaith, he will execute judgement upon the heathen in ſuch a manner <hi>as was never heard of. Dan.</hi> 12.1. He ſpeaks of troubles, and ſuch as there <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was ſince there was a Nation to that time.</hi> Theſe ſtrange unheard of judgements, uncouth puniſhments, adde much to the terrour of the plague. Doe you thinke it was not fearfull to thoſe of the old world, to ſee it raine forty dayes together, and not to ceaſe till the very Arke mounted? And to thoſe of <hi>Sodome</hi> to ſee it raine fire, who had ever heard of it before? And marke that in <hi>Num.</hi> 16. when <hi>Moſes</hi> would aggravate the judgement that God meant to ſend upon <hi>Corah,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>If theſe men dye the common death, or if they be viſited with the common viſitation of all men,</hi> thinke as you will; but if God make a <hi>new thing,</hi> and cauſe the earth to open, and ſwallow them quicke in the pit, then ſay they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God to ſome purpoſe. A new, ſtrange, and not a common viſitation, and death; for that was never heard of before, that the earth ſhould cleave and ſwallow them into hell. Theſe judgements that were laid upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> were made patternes for after times, <hi>I will puniſh you after
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:158707:48"/>the way of Egypt.</hi> So that it ſeems that the Egyptians were the firſt inſtances of thoſe great calamities; God begun with them in this way, they were the firſt.</p>
            <p>So, in this caſe it falls out, as in examples of good, ſo in the puniſhment of evill. We ſay the way to heaven is ſhort by example, though it be long by precept. The reaſon is this; becauſe when a man is commanded to doe a thing, and is told that another doth it before him, he is comforted, he perſwades himſelfe it is in his factivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe another hath done it: ſo in the puniſhment of ſinne, if it be ſomewhat that another hath ſuffered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is ſome comfort. If it be ſuch a thing that never any ſuffered, that a man can ſay that truly that <hi>Iob</hi> ſpake paſſionately, that God had made him a <hi>Butt,</hi> for ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable judgements as never were before: This is a great aggravation.</p>
            <p>Now you muſt know, that theſe ſtrange, extraordinary judgements are for foule and extraordinary ſinnes; for when men will exceed their ſcantling, and tranſcend in iniquity; the Lord will make his plagues wonderfull. In <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. And there are <hi>ſtrange puniſhments to the workers of iniquity, Iob</hi> 31. Wondrous ſtrange plagues to thoſe that have new ſins.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of it; it may ſatisfie us to the full, for thoſe judgements that God brings upon the world in theſe laſt times. Wee ſtill ſay that there are diſeaſes growne among us that we have not heard of before; ſure I am they put the Phyſitians paſt their bookes many times: let us not wonder at this; for <hi>Affrica</hi> is not more fertile of monſters, then theſe our times are fruitfull in iniquity; I, and in new ſinnes.</p>
            <p>I dare appeale to your owne obſervation what new
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:158707:48"/>ſtrange oaths have beene minted of later times that our forefathers never heard of? the fouleſt blaſphemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt heaven not to be mentioned. What new ſtrange wayes of epicurianiſme and gluttony? how wity is that ſinne in this age, as if the ſpirit of <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> were in men; who when he was ſatiated with all that was in uſe, gave encouragement to any man by a crier to invent new? I dare be bold to ſay, that god, the belly, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſerved with ſuch uncouth ſervice as now. What ſtrange wayes of drinking, that were never heard of in the time of our forefathers? the dayes then were more modeſt, and free from that foule, abominable corruption. What ſtrange unknown faſhions in apparrell! how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious is this laſt age growne in that? A man can as ſoone make the Moone a coat, as finde people a moneth in one dreſſing. It is fearfull to conſider the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable luxury. And for fraud, and cheating, and tricks of legerdemaine, they are freſh and new, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent every day; that the vigilancie of all authority, and the warineſſe of all lawes are not able to prevent them. He is accounted but a foole and a ſot that hath not a trick more then ever yet was practiſed.</p>
            <p>O, Beloved! hath not God then a juſt controverſie with his people? If the Lord draw out judgements that were never heard of before, and make us ſignes and wonders to the world, and an aſtoniſhment to all adjacent Nations, may we not juſtifie his proceedings? If wee exceed our forefathers ſinnes, what wonder is it, if wee feele judgements that they were never ſenſible of? If we be inventers of the evill of ſinne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. what won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is it, if the Lord deale with us as he did with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, to give us up to a <hi>reprobate ſenſe,</hi> to deſperate hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:158707:49"/>that after we have committed ſinne with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, we may be made a by word to all Nations?</p>
            <p>But before I leave this denunciation of the judgement, I cannot but acquaint you with the myſticall ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that divers of the Fathers have of this judgement of <hi>frogs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, The <hi>frogs</hi> here, ſignifie laſcivious vaine Poets: ſaith he, a <hi>frog</hi> is of no profit, he gives offence with his croaking, and with his filth: ſo ſaith he, It is with the Poets, they are as <hi>frogs,</hi> they have no good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: the laſcivious Poets in their libidinous diſcourſes, and their fables, that tend to nothing but to corrupt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable men: Yet to ſee how many people are taken with them (ſaith he) how they ſucke this poyſon, and drinke theſe puddles with the neglect of thoſe living waters.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Rupertus</hi> goes further: They be <hi>frogs</hi> that croke diſhonour to God when they attribute a deity and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> and thoſe that were mortall men, and make as many as their owne fancie thinks fit, uſing the fecundity of their underſtandings this way: Yet theſe people (ſaith he) as <hi>frogs,</hi> creep into the favour of great perſons, as appeares in the ſtory, they are made much of by the great Emperours of the world: but ſaith he, though they delight in them for the preſent, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe a great deale of poyſon, more then ever they could be cured of.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Auſten,</hi> and with him <hi>Proſper;</hi> they underſtand myſtically by theſe <hi>frogs,</hi> Philoſophers, that were wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only to naturall knowledge. Theſe are they, ſaith <hi>Auſten,</hi> that have a ſound of words, but not true wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: ſaith he, ſometimes they croke out filthy blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt God. He is not utterly againſt Philoſopy,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:158707:49"/>nor no wiſe man ever would: for as it may be as <hi>Hagar</hi> againſt <hi>Sara;</hi> if it grow petulent and ſawcie as ſhe did, out goes the handmaid. So this Heathen, having her nailes pared, and her haire cut, ſhe may be a wife for an Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite. He is againſt vaine Philoſophy (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks) thoſe things that are contrary to truth; when they would make it impoſſible for any thing to be made of nothing, againſt the creation of the world: when they deny that ſeverall <hi>ſpecies</hi> can be united in one ſubject, againſt the incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt: when they deny that there can be any returne from a privation to a habit, againſt the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Theſe are crokings and diſtaſtefull to Chriſtian eares.</p>
            <p>The ſame Father ſaith further: Theſe croking <hi>frogs</hi> ſet forth Hereticks; and in <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.13. the Spirit of God calls them <hi>frogs</hi> that creep out of the mouth of the <hi>Beaſt, the falſe Prophet, and the Dragon.</hi> And theſe runne up and downe, and crawle upon people, and doe a great deale of prejudice. And he might well put them after Philoſophers: for <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, Philoſophers are the Patriarchs of Hereticks. And he ſaith elſewhere, when they cannot flye of themſelves, then they take ſhelter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the buſhes of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Theſe Hereticks are as <hi>frogs,</hi> filthy, creeping up and downe, and creeping over places, even into the chambers of Princes: as may appear to you in the <hi>Arrians</hi> that made themſelves ſo firme in the Emperour <hi>Conſtantius.</hi> That is the tricke of them to make themſelves great with great perſons. It is ſaid of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> ſiſter <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſhe commended one of them to him. They get into the chambers of Princes. We need not have theſe croking <hi>frogs</hi> in theſe dayes, with their Jeſuiticall ſpirits: If Princes would be
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:158707:50"/>more cautelous of them, it would be more for their peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregory Nycene,</hi> in the life of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaith, That the <hi>frogs</hi> are voluptuous perſons, that are given up to all wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton luxury that is carnall: For, ſaith he, thinke of a libi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinous licentious life, and then thinke of the <hi>frogs</hi> of <hi>Egypt;</hi> for that ſame licentiouſneſſe growes from a filthy heart; ſo theſe <hi>frogs</hi> from the ſlime of <hi>Egypt.</hi> And as it was with thoſe <hi>frogs,</hi> ſo it is with theſe; they poſſeſſe all places. In the ſtreet take a voluptuous man, and you ſhall diſcover him by his publicke carriage. Follow him to his houſe, he is voluptuous in his meat; as theſe <hi>frogs</hi> came into the <hi>baking-troughs.</hi> Follow him into his bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, he is wicked there. Follow him to his cloſet, the greateſt privacie, ſtill there are ſignes of voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And he begins to complaine, how full that time was of theſe <hi>frogs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His complaint fits our times: It is a fearfull thing; the filthy <hi>frogs</hi> of covetouſneſſe, baſe, ſordid covetouſneſſe; of exceſſe, and of diſtemper, of luſt, and licentiouſneſſe, that may be followed by their ſlime from the places they paſſe. Theſe are fearfull, and thoſe that expoſe the land to the curſe of God. Take heed of theſe; ſeparate your ſelves from this uncleanneſſe: in ſuch impure hearts God will not dwell. They may taſte of his vengeance, but ſhall never taſte of his favour till they have purged out this filthy corruption. So I have done wholly with the denunciation of the judgement.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the execution of it, and in the tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it (becauſe I cannot enter on it at this time.) It will be demanded what effect the denunciation of this judgement had with <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> There is nothing ſaid, the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:158707:50"/>judgement is denounced, and is preſently executed; what effect had it?</p>
            <p>The ſpeedy execution of it, tells us what effect it had: For ſurely <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was not a whit wounded, his wicked heart continued obdurate, and impenitent. It is like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, he conceived that this was but a ſcar-crow; and he thought it a poore ſpirit, and a baſe diſpoſition, to yeeld to words; he would not appeare to be puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous to be frighted with words, therefore he ſtands it out. Obſerve:
<q>The wicked diſpoſition of prophane perſons; they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver feare, till they feele.</q> 
               <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> all the words would doe no good, he was fearleſſe till he feels. Thus it was with the old world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>They did eat and drinke, and were merry, and knew nothing till the flood came.</hi> Bleſſed Lord, did they know nothing? Had not <hi>Noah, that preacher of righteouſneſſe, told them by word of mouth?</hi> Had he not preached in making the Arke? For, ſaith <hi>Baſile</hi> of <hi>Selu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> it was a preaching, and every knock was an urging of that point; did they not know? without doubt they did. How is it ſaid, They knew not? <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, he ſheweth their inſenſibleneſſe, and ſecurity, when hee ſaith, They knew not: and he ſaith, They were taken with a kinde of drunkenneſſe in their ſinnes: As a man that ſleeps upon a Maſt, knows not that he is in danger. So it was with them: judgement was at the doore, <hi>yet they knew nothing till Noah entred into the Arke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So thoſe of <hi>Sodome,</hi> were in the ſame predicament; <hi>Lot</hi> told them, and bid them feare: It would not be; and as judgement drew nearer, he was more fervent in his exhortation; all would not doe, <hi>he ſeemed to his owne
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:158707:51"/>ſons as if he had mocked, Gen.</hi> 19. for they thought with themſelves, what newes is this? Fire from heaven! <hi>Why ſhall not to morrow be as to day?</hi> Who ever ſaw it raine fire? or if it doe, muſt this valley burne alone, and none elſe? What ground is there for this?</p>
            <p>Thus God layes out the humour of wicked men, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19. <hi>He that heares the curſes of this booke, and ſaith I ſhall have peace, though I continue ſtiffenecked, &amp;c.</hi> This is the very conceit that a wicked man hath, he may goe on in his ſinnes; he needs not feare the judgement to come, he ſhall have peace, though he continue ſtiffenecked. Was not this the humour of <hi>Achab?</hi> did not <hi>Micaiah</hi> tell him of the diſſipation of his Army? Nay did he not plainly ſay, <hi>If he returned in peace, the Lord had not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by him?</hi> yet he purſued his reſolution, and went on in his way; he would not feare till he felt, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. Marke, in <hi>Iſay</hi> 5.19. The Lord brings wicked men, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Make haſte, let him haſten his worke that we may ſee it.</hi> A wicked, prophane ſpeech as ever came from the mouth of man. They mocked the judgement that God had told them of. Doth God ſay he will bring judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, let him make haſte, we would faine ſee it: theſe are but words, we would faine ſee deeds. Thus wicked men haſten to their ruine. So, in <hi>Ieremy,</hi> they tell the Prophet flatly hee lies, when hee ſaid, The King of <hi>Chalde</hi> ſhall come and take <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> they would not be perſwaded till they felt it. So in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12.22. There was a Proverb growne in <hi>Iſrael, Every viſion faileth.</hi> As if they had ſaid, Shall we give heed to the dreams of the Prophets? They ſay they have had viſions, but all fail, there are none come to paſſe; they would not believe them. And what better were thoſe mockers in <hi>Peter;</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:158707:51"/>they mocked, and ſaid, <hi>Where is the promiſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming?</hi> As if they ſhould ſay; We will not give over our pleaſures, and the proſecuting of our ſinfull luſts; we will take time while we may, and crowne our heads with roſe buds, and make as much of our ſelves as wee can; for, for ought we ſee all things are in a ſtay, there is nothing to come.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of this: I deſire from my ſoule, that all of us, you, and I, and every one, would take heed above all, of ſecurity, of fearleſſeneſſe of God. Our Bleſſed Saviour ſaid long agoe, that it ſhould be the ſinne of the laſt times. <hi>As it was in the dayes of Noah, and of Lot, ſo ſhall it be in the day of the ſonne of man.</hi> And they <hi>ſhall nouriſh their hearts as in the day of ſlaughter.</hi> And they ſhall have a conceit that judgement is far off, and that it ſhall not come at all; and ſo be given up to voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to <hi>commit ſin with greedineſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I dare appeale, and let your conſciences anſwer, and eccho the truth; have not we a thouſand times told you of plague, and famine, and judgement great and ſmall? Have we not rung in the eares of the blaſphemer that the flying booke with curſes would come into his houſe? Have we not rung in the eares of the bloody man, that he ſhould <hi>not live out halfe his dayes,</hi> and that he ſhould not dye a drie death? Have we not ſpoken loud enough over and over, to the licentious perſon, that that ſinne would eat out his poſterity, and conſume his increaſe? Have wee not told you, that the oppreſſour ſhould have his goods invaded by violence, and taken out of the mouthes of his children? Have we not told the curſer that it ſhould <hi>come into his bowels as water?</hi> Have we not told him that is exceſſive, that he ſhould reap no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:158707:52"/>but ſhame, and diſhonour, and beggery, the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and untimely death? Have we not ſaid all this? But with what ſucceſſe? People perſiſt in the ſame wayes, in the ſame impieties every day. Witneſſe the renewing, and the improving of theſe ſinnes. Some are as deafe Adders; or if they heare, they give us the hearing, and that is all; they are ſtill in the ſame courſe of impiety. What is the ground of all? Security, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſeneſſe of judgements; they thinke theſe things are bug-beares to fray children, thoſe things that ſhall never take effect. Theſe are the things that the Devill puts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hearts of people to couſen them of their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>O let us take heed: Let me tell you, and out of the truth of Gods Word, that men are never nearer judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then when they are moſt ſecure, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.4. <hi>When they ſhall ſay, peace, peace, ſudden deſtruction ſhall come. Chryſoſtomes</hi> obſervation is, when they ſhall ſay, <hi>peace, peace;</hi> he ſaith not that there is peace to them: <hi>For what peace as long as the whoredomes of Iezebel remaine?</hi> As <hi>Iehu</hi> ſaid: But when <hi>they ſhall ſay peace,</hi> and all is in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility. Thoſe of <hi>Sodome,</hi> they had a faire morning that day they were conſumed; but how ſoone were the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens clouded with fire and brimſtone! So likewiſe <hi>Belteſhazer</hi> was in all his jollity, and his ruffe, with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines, and Princes quaffing in the veſſels of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; in the height of that ſecurity, the hand-writing on the wall makes his knees knock together, and the joynts of his body looſed. So <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> his grandfather, when he was ſtrouting upon his Babell, and bragged of his power, then God turnes him among the beaſts. The people of <hi>Laiſh,</hi> when they were buried in ſecurity, the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:158707:52"/>children of <hi>Dan</hi> fall upon them to deſtroy them. <hi>Amnon</hi> when his heart was merry with wine, little thought hee of any miſchiefe; all on the ſudden he was ſlaine. So <hi>Agag, O,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the bitterneſſe of death is paſt now;</hi> there was no feare then of judgement as he thought: the next newes that he heard, the ſword of <hi>Samuel</hi> was thruſt into his bowels, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>I might ſhew many inſtances that when men are moſt ſecure, God comes with his judgements, and hath taken them away. Therefore take heed of being fearleſſe of the judgements of God. Beleeve what God hath ſaid to us; and as we beleeve, ſo let it urge us to prepare, and if we be prepared, either we ſhall be hid in the evill day, or the affliction ſhall be ſo ſanctified, that we ſhall finde honey in that Lion.</p>
            <p>Another thing I would commend to your conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſomething of kin to this point in hand. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> holds out, God ſends a meſſage, it will not be, God now executes.</p>
            <q>Where words will not ſerve, blows muſt.</q>
            <p>I ſhall not need to give inſtances of this, there are enow in Scripture. And there is great reaſon that God ſhould doe it.</p>
            <p>For if he ſhould only content himſelfe with words, his truth would be called in queſtion, as if he had ſaid that that he meant not to performe, if that word that he hath ſpoken ſhall not take effect.</p>
            <p>Secondly, his Juſtice would be queſtioned that hee hates not ſinne with that hatred that the world is perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, his Power would be queſtioned, that though he hate ſin, and threaten it; yet he were not able to puniſh it.</p>
            <pb n="92" facs="tcp:158707:53"/>
            <p>Laſtly, his Wiſdome and Providence would be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned; for it is not the part of a wiſe man, where there is deſert for blowes, to content himſelfe only with words; for this makes reproofe contemptible, and all ſpeeches ridiculous, and turne againe upon him with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of it, it ſhould teach us to juſtifie God in all his proceedings, ever give glory to God, whatſoever falls: for certainly God for the contempt of ordinary proceedings is faine to goe to a more ſevere reckoning with men: they juſtly deſerve it: therefore God is to be juſtified.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſince God is ſo leaſurely, and treatable in his pace to vengeance; Let us all make uſe of the delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate proceedings of God: feare Gods word, and wee ſhall never feare his blowes, that is true. It is a ſpeech of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> to good purpoſe; Let a man feare Gods word, and he ſhall never need to feare thoſe acts of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. Let them feare in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Rome:</hi> let him feare and ſtand in awe that offends. If a man be carefull to lead a holy life, he need not be afraid, though the hills tumble into the ſea, and the foundations of the earth be raſed, he ſhall ſtand unappaled in the middeſt of all dangers. So that ſpeech of <hi>Gregory,</hi> and it is good counſell that he gives, Let us feare when we heare, leſt we come to feare when we feele, which is worſt of all. For, beloved, it is hard to be put to the tutorage of that School-miſtris, experience. If a man feare not till hee feele, then wrath will fall the heavier. The Wiſe man takes another courſe, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>A wiſe man ſeeth the plague, and hideth himſelfe;</hi> but a foole <hi>goeth on, and is puniſhed,</hi> he will not be warned and admoniſhed.</p>
            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:158707:53"/>
            <p>God comes to many men; nay to all by the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his word, he tells us what is due to ſinne; what he will inflict: he ſometimes by leſſe chaſtiſements, as his leſſer ordnance playes upon us: doth not God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect profit by this? If we doe not he will inlarge puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon people, and ſo much more the blows ſhal be, becauſe of the contempt of his gracious proceedings; and then men ſhall have no body to complaine of but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and curſe the time a thouſand fold that they did not obey the word of God, but would needs ſtand it out till it came to blowes, now the fearfull hand of God is fallen upon them. It was the complaint of <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 9. <hi>We hearkned not to the voyce of thy Prophets, now therefore thy wrath is ſtretched upon us to the full:</hi> As he ſaith there.</p>
            <p>Therefore my counſell ſhall be, to feare the word of God, and we ſhall not need to feare his judgements, tremble at his threatnings: Get the heart of <hi>Ioſiah</hi> to melt when he read the Law of God, he had reſpect to the Word, that he <hi>trembled at his word,</hi> and was contrite in that manner, that he was deeply caſt downe with the conſideration of his menacies and threatnings. God will be mercifull to ſuch a one, and he ſhall eſcape in the day of vengeance; whereas thoſe that are refractory and contumacious, that care not for words till it come to blowes, they ſhall be ſure to ſucke the dregs of Gods vialls.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving ſpoken of the denunciation of this judgement, I come now to the ſecond thing, The execution of it, which is laid downe in verſ. 5.6. where there is,</p>
            <p>Firſt, the injunction.</p>
            <p>And then the performance of that injunction.</p>
            <p>The injunction verſe 5. <hi>God ſaid to Moſes, ſay to Aaron, ſtretch forth thine hand with thy rod, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="95" facs="tcp:158707:54"/>
            <p>The performance of this, verſe 6. <hi>Aaron</hi> did ſo.</p>
            <p>In the former of theſe, the injunction, <hi>God ſpake to Moſes, ſay unto Aaron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A man might ſay; Why did not <hi>Moſes</hi> take the rod as well as <hi>Aaron?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are divers reaſons given why <hi>Moſes</hi> did not doe it, but <hi>Aaron</hi> rather.</p>
            <p>The Hebrewes, they, (according to their fabulous manner) ſay, it was not fit for <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſmite the river; becauſe he was preſerved in the water when time was, as we read in the ſtory, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2. when he floated in an arke of bulruſhes, <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter tooke him up. Hee ſhould have beene ungratefull to thoſe ſtreames to have ſmitten them with a plague that were the meanes of his preſervation.</p>
            <p>It is true, beloved, that gratitude works not only to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, but toward the brute creatures, even to the place where, and inſtruments by which a man is benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but this is no ſolid reaſon. Suppoſe <hi>Moſes</hi> received never ſo much good there; thankfulneſſe to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would not beare him out in diſobedience to the Creator.</p>
            <p>Another ſaith, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was not to doe it, becauſe the Egyptians then would have beene perſwaded that he had done it by ſorcery, and ſo they would have beene leſſe moved, and perſwaded by it: They were ſo unjuſt that they conceived of <hi>Moſes</hi> that he was a ſorcerer. The truth is, that he had all the learning of the Egyptians, and it is likely that many of them uſed that Art; yet we know nothing of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but that he was exerciſed in thoſe ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that were juſtifiable.</p>
            <p>Againe, if this were the reaſon, <hi>Aaron</hi> might have
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:158707:55"/>beene ſuſpected; for he lived among them a great age, and without doubt <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would have brought it out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Calvin</hi> gives a third reaſon, God would not have <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtrike the ſtreames, and bring the <hi>frogs,</hi> but <hi>Aaron;</hi> that <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in regard of his pride and inſolencie, might be handled more contemptibly. As if <hi>Moſes</hi> would let him ſee that be would not trouble himſelfe, but his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that was to officiate for him, he ſhould doe it.</p>
            <p>There is a fourth reaſon; God hath ſet downe an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; he gives <hi>Moſes</hi> direction what to doe, and from him <hi>Moſes</hi> directs <hi>Aaron,</hi> and he executes it. Therefore God having appointed and ordained it, he looks that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſhould performe his office; and that ſhall be our obſervation:
<q>When God hath diſtinguiſhed men in ſeverall places, and given them ſeverall ſpheres to move in, he requires that they ſhould walke in their places.</q> It is ſaid of the Tree, <hi>he ſhall bring forth his owne fruit.</hi> It is ſaid of the Sunne <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>he rejoyceth like a Giant to run his owne courſe.</hi> And you ſhall finde <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7. the Apoſtle chargeth the man that hath an office to attend it, to looke to his owne imployment without interlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in another mans affaires. So in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.24. every man is charged to <hi>abide in the place that God hath ſet him in.</hi> That intimates, not only faithfulneſſe and diligence, but wiſdome and conſcience, in a man to doe that that belongs to his place. So the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.11. wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every man to doe his owne buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>In the body, as there are ſeverall parts, ſo every part hath a ſeverall imployment that it is to attend. See in a Family, the Maſter hath a ſeverall place from the ſervant. It is not fit for another man to ſteppe into the place of a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:158707:55"/>Steward; nor for the groome of the ſtable, to come into the place of the Gentleman of the chamber. So in the Church of God, it is <hi>an army with banners:</hi> the Apoſtle would have it without ſcandall. It is a well ordered Army. Now in an Army when men are digeſted into ſeverall rankes; it is not for a Pike man to thruſt himſelfe into a file of Muſqueteers, every man muſt keep his own place, or elſe he is diſordered, and that may prove mortall. So, in the Church of God all the company muſt be orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, there muſt be diſcipline, and every man muſt know what belongs to his place. If a man goe out of his rank, and doe that that belongs to another man, though with never ſo good intention; it may be ſaid to him, as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter</hi> when he ſolicited him about <hi>Iohn, What is that to thee? Vzzah</hi> had better have adventured the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Arke, though it tottered, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. when hee knew that no hand muſt meddle with it but that which was holy. You ſee how God was avenged on <hi>Vzziah</hi> that would doe the worke of another mans calling, and neglect his owne, when he uſurped the Prieſts office, God ſmote him with leproſie, he made him live a retired man all his life.</p>
            <p>In the Ancient Councell, the 60 Canon, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that thoſe people that were Chriſtians, that ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red death for pulling downe the Images of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, they ſhould not bee enrolled for martyrs. The ground was good.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, there was indiſcreet ambition of heart in it.</item>
               <item>Secondly, they did that that belonged not to their place. And thoſe that ſuffered in the time of <hi>Peter,</hi> as <hi>buſie men in other mens matters,</hi> they had no comfort in their ſufferings.</item>
            </list>
            <pb n="98" facs="tcp:158707:56"/>
            <p>In the 26 Oration of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> there the holy Father ſpeakes ſo much concerning order, and every man poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing his owne place, that if I could repeat it wholly to you, you need no other Sermon. Saith he, all things are in order; the Heavens above, the Sunne, Moon, and Starres; yea when they fought againſt <hi>Syſera,</hi> they fought in order. So the things below; the very times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the yeare are ordered; the day and night are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, ſaith hee. When we read of thunder and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in heaven, and thoſe ſhaking commotions in the bowells of the earth; of ſhipwracks by ſea, and wars by land, and diſeaſes in mens bodies, and ſinnes in their ſoules; theſe are the beames of trouble and confuſion, and not of order. Saith he, What ſhall the diſſolution of the world be at the laſt, but a confuſion? Who ever ſaw the Oxe ſwim over the ſea? or the graſſe grow on trees? doth the eye of man performe the office of the foot? or the foot the office of the eye? The eye walks not but leads, and the foot doth not ſee, but walke, it doth that that is fit for it. The eare doth not trouble it ſelfe to ſpeake, or the tongue to heare. Order is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſecurity to all things. So he goes on a great way, and concludes, Let every man keep his ranke, and do his duty in his place, eſpecially in the Church, wherein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, men are ſaid to be in order.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of it, it meets with the Pope of <hi>Rome:</hi> If he had learned this, he would have caſt away his keyes before he had received them; or if he had medled with it, he would not doe two mens workes; he would have ſaid, <hi>Who made me a judge?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The doing of two mens workes is common in theſe times, we know not what belongs to our ſelves, wee
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:158707:56"/>meddle with other mens affaires. Lay people will preach the Word, and adminiſter the Sacraments. You ſhall have a Cobler above his Laſt, and take upon him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Scriptures, and not ſticke to informe the Miniſter how he ſhould preach. Doe you not ſee a great number of people of inferiour ranke take upon them to reforme evills? If a man ſhould ſay to them, as they did to <hi>Moſes, Who made thee a judge?</hi> They would reply, It is their zeale. I tell them their zeale is not according to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for if their judgements were rightly informed, they would know that God hath appointed a man the worke of his place, and no man ſhould extend himſelfe beyond the latitude of his owne calling.</p>
            <p>And whereas they have pretended, they have <hi>Samſon</hi> and <hi>Phineas,</hi> and many more; they may well adde <hi>Elias,</hi> and <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> thoſe ſonnes of thunder that light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſhrewdly when they called for fire from heaven; for ſuch they pretend all theſe, and well they may. It is ill reaſoning from things ill done, to that that ſhould bee done; or if they did it immediately we muſt not bring them to an example.</p>
            <p>Secondly, learne every one to doe that that is right in his place; the Maſter of the family in his, the father in his, and the children in theirs; and all as God hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of them. If they goe out of this, it is an unſeemly thing. Is it not an unſeemly thing to ſee the ſtreames run over the bankes? to ſee the fire off from the hearth? to ſee a man out of his place? to ſee the glove drawne on the wrong hand, how ugly is it? Therefore the former Father <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> puts diſorder, and deformity together; and he might well ſay it. The Apoſtle puts order and beauty together; <hi>Let all things be done decently, &amp; in order.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="100" facs="tcp:158707:57"/>
            <p>Secondly, a man doth not need to meddle with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if he looke to his owne charge, God will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed well enough with that: whereas if a man neglect his owne, and meddle with others, he may have that ſaid to him, that he is skilfull in other mens affaires, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his owne.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, when a man hath done that that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to his place, it may be he ſees other people defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, it is not for him to leap out of his calling; he may well mourne for it, and as occaſion ſerves, and his calling will afford, he may adviſe, and pray to God to incline the hearts of thoſe that have power to redreſſe theſe things; let him not thinke he ſhall ſuffer for other mens defects; for every man ſtands or falls to his owne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. So much for that. The next thing I note,
<q>Say unto Aaron, take thy rod, &amp;c.</q> Some may ſay, What needs this? when God with a word could have done this, what need he ſtretch out his rod?</p>
            <p>It is true, there is none that doubts of the power of God, what God could have done: But the point is this;
<q>Where God hath appointed meanes, he will have them uſed, and not have miracles expected.</q> He ſtretched out the rod. It was that that God had ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified for this purpoſe, God will have the meanes uſed. All the world knowes, God could have preſerved <hi>Noah</hi> without an Arke: He meant to drowne the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; and he had fixed this way; <hi>Noah</hi> muſt work in this meanes. Every man will conceive that eaſily God could have preſerved <hi>Lot</hi> in the middeſt of <hi>Sodome,</hi> though all the City were burned about him; but ſince he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:158707:57"/>
               <hi>Zear</hi> for a refuge, there he muſt flye, and take the courſe that he had appointed.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt but God could have recovered <hi>Hezechiah</hi> to health by a word; but ſince God ſaid a bunch of figs ſhould be uſed, that muſt be applied, or elſe he could not amend. Doe you thinke that God was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, and unable to cure <hi>Naaman</hi> of his leproſie? with a word he could have done it; but having appointed <hi>Iordan</hi> the place to waſh him, and to waſh ſeven times, except he had gone, and performed it, whatſoever hee did thinke of <hi>Pharphar,</hi> and the rivers of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he had waſhed there he had not beene cleane. God could have hid the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>Iudea,</hi> maugre the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of <hi>Herod;</hi> but having appointed <hi>Egypt</hi> to be the place, thither they muſt flye.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Muſculus</hi> upon <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſaith, that Chriſt cauſed the ſtone to be taken away; he that could raiſe his body, why would he not raiſe the ſtone? God will not worke mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles for ordinary things, where the labour of man will ſerve.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of this, I deſire you to remember it for your ſpirituall, and corporall condition.</p>
            <p>For the bodily condition, it is well knowne that God hath appointed labour to be the means of ſuſtentation of theſe tabernacles of ours; yet this meanes is not uſed. There are a great number of men that looke to be fed as <hi>Eliah</hi> was by the ravens, by miracle; they thinke to lye, and have the meat fall into their mouths; no paines will they take. Theſe kinde of people that will be idle, and like the doore on the hinges that will not uſe the meanes; they will not put their ſoules a foot out, as it is in the fable; they ſinne againſt the generall order of things.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:158707:58"/>The heavens ſtand not ſtill, but by miracle. And they ſinne againſt pure nature; when man was in his innecency God provided him labour, <hi>Thou ſhalt dreſſe the garden:</hi> Surely that God that appointed a Sabbath, intended not man to be idle. They ſinne againſt corrupted nature; ſince the fall, <hi>Man is borne to labour as the ſparkes flye upward.</hi> And man muſt eat his bread with ſweat: And the Heathen had this light to call them flow bellies. Laſtly, they ſinne againſt the ſtore of nature. It lyes on Chriſtians mainly, they are ſo farre from the uſing the meanes of labour to effect that that God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they muſt withdraw themſelves from men that live inordinatly; <hi>He that will not labour muſt not eat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, let no man love his eaſe ſo well, that hee refuſe labour, that his ſides ſhould ake; as that man in <hi>Seneca,</hi> becauſe he ſees another man take paines, this is odious.</p>
            <p>And let not men be carried away with a private ſpirit, as a great number are that except their imployment bee generous, they will rather doe nothing. If the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be never ſo poore, if it be honeſt, it is better then to be idle ten thouſand times. The idle man diſhonours God, he tranſgreſſeth his commandements; he wrongs many beſides himſelfe: his Country, the Church, his family, and the poore; all challenge a part in him. When a man ſhall aske his conſcience, what profit hath the Church, or thy family, or the poore, or the State by thee? If he ſay nothing; it is a pitifull thing.</p>
            <p>Againe, when a man doth nothing, he is expoſed to all temptations. The Devill entred when he found none at home. The Iron ruſts with lying. The Field un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plowed overgrowes with weeds. Standing puddles
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:158707:58"/>ſtinke: therefore it was <hi>Ieromes</hi> counſell to <hi>Ruſticut,</hi> Alway to be imployed.</p>
            <p>Againe, it is a reproach to the world: there is never a generous man, if he ſee another that labours not, but he accounts him an unprofitable burthen to the earth.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it drawes upon a man the miſery of another world. Shall ſuch a man live? If he doe, he hath but his ſoule to keep him out of hell: and St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, ſuch people are <hi>dead while they live.</hi> How ſhall they live when they be dead, that are dead while they live? What ſaith God? <hi>Binde him hand and foot, and caſt him into utter darkneſſe,</hi> to the unprofitable ſervant.</p>
            <p>Therefore hearken to God, take paines in that courſe that God hath appointed in his word: let us rather eat our owne bread then to live at another mans finding.</p>
            <p>If this ſeeme a digreſſion, I deſire you to pardon it; for it may be of purpoſe I turned out of my way to turne ſome idle ones into it.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, for our ſpirituall eſtate, God will have meanes uſed there: <hi>The Kingdome of Heaven comes not with obſervation,</hi> as it is ſaid in the Goſpell. Many prophane men ſay; What! cannot God ſave us without all this preaching? What! nothing without that <hi>rod,</hi> that Scepter of God, his Word; the <hi>rod</hi> of <hi>Aaron?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is dangerous to diſpute what God can doe; farre be it from us: But when God hath appointed meanes ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, he ſhewes that he will not ſave without them. The Evnuch might have ſaid to <hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Ananias,</hi> and <hi>Lidia</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> God can doe this without you; but God muſt be ſerved that way that he hath appointed.</p>
            <p>Therefore if a man thinke to be ſaved by a miracle, he ſhall fall ſhort of ſalvation. The rich man in hell had a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:158707:59"/>ſtrange deſire to ſave his brethren by one that roſe from the dead; but ſaith <hi>Abraham, If they will not heare Moſes and the Prophets, they will not heare them.</hi> So much for that. Saith he:
<q>Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod, and cauſe the frogs to aſcend.</q> What! muſt <hi>Aaron</hi> bring <hi>frogs</hi> out of the river? What man hath power to make one haire of his head, white or blacke, <hi>Who can adde one cubite to his ſtature?</hi> Muſt <hi>Aaron</hi> bring theſe <hi>frogs?</hi> So in the originall it is an imparative, <hi>Make</hi> or <hi>command them to aſcend.</hi> So the Septuagint is, Fetch thou them forth. We muſt acknowledge the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God to be infinite: Yet obſerve,
<q>The workes that are his owne he attributes to men.</q> 
               <hi>Aaron</hi> is ſaid to bring them. The bringing of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> it was the worke of God, with a mighty Arme, none but God could doe it. He aſſumes it oft-times, <hi>I am the Lord that brought thee out of the land of Egypt.</hi> So, thoſe holy people acknowledged <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel; O God that broughteſt us out of Egypt:</hi> Yet this act is attributed to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> So God ſaith to <hi>Gede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Iud.</hi> 6. <hi>Goe and deliver Iſrael;</hi> yet it was God that muſt doe it. So it is ſaid of <hi>Samſon,</hi> and <hi>Shamger,</hi> and <hi>Othoneele,</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> that they delivered <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And God ſaith to <hi>Moſes, Sanctifie to me the people againſt the third day;</hi> yet God muſt ſanctifie them. So, we ſee in the New Teſtament, that converſion is attributed to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and remiſſion of ſinnes: <hi>Whoſe ſinnes ye remit are remitted:</hi> Nay, and the ſaving of men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.11.</p>
            <p>This is the honour of Gods Saints: God not only u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them, but attributes to them what is done. To arm them againſt diſcouragements, though many things
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:158707:59"/>obſtaculous to them lye in the way, and confront them, and be impediments to them; yet let them be comforted in this, the iſſue and effect that is wrought, God will pleaſe to honour them with it; he will part with ſome of his owne to give them: he will put a ſplendour on <hi>Moſes,</hi> and make him glorious in the eyes of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. God is content to give <hi>Iehu</hi> honour: <hi>The ſword of the Lord, and of Gedeon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though indeed we muſt take heed, if we be ſenſible of the honour that God puts upon men when he imployes them, that we doe nothing to diminiſh the glory of God. The Devill is ſo ſubtle, and the corruption of mans heart is ſo great, that he deſires praiſe to himſelfe. So that oft-times the chiefe Lord ſuffers by the unfaithfulneſſe of his Steward. Let us take heed, if God honour us for doing good things by him; aſſume not ſo much to our ſelves, whereby Gods glory may be diminiſhed.</p>
            <p>Let me apply it to thoſe of the Church, God hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured them exceedingly, that he hath made them fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low workers with himſelfe, to diſpenſe the great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Kingdome. And it is the obſervation of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,</hi> when the Prodigall returned, the father doth not bid him goe to the wardrobe, and take the beſt robe; but he ſaid to the ſervants, <hi>Goe and fetch it.</hi> He would have the ſervants imployed for the benefit of the ſonne, that the meanes might be brought in credit.</p>
            <p>That ſhewes how much the world is beholding to the Miniſters of the Word: <hi>We are co-workers with God;</hi> which as it may comfort us for the preſent, ſo it ſhall adde to our crowne afterward.</p>
            <p>But let us take heed that we give the glory to God, and not take to our ſelves any thing that may diminiſh
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:158707:60"/>Gods honour: Let us be of the ſpirit of <hi>Paul, I laboured more then all, yet not I, but the grace of God in me.</hi> Saith <hi>Auſten, Nos mandamus, &amp;c.</hi> we do not give the increaſe, we doe but helpe; and this, that we can helpe is not of our ſelves, but the grace of God: <hi>Paul may plant, and Apollo may water, but it is God that muſt give the increaſe. Not unto us, not unto us, but to thy Name be the praiſe given:</hi> So ſhould be the ſpeech of every one. We are Stars, but we are Stars in the right hand of our Bleſſed Lord, and he is the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſſe.</hi> So, we have it by derivation from him; we ſhine in a borrowed light.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for people, ſince God hath advanced Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, know the neceſſity of their calling; though God made you without them, he will not ſave you without them. Know that you muſt reverence them for <hi>their workes ſake.</hi> Shew your reſpect by doing that which is commanded; for therein lyes the eſpeciall reſpect to a Miniſter, when that is practiſed that he teacheth.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place; ſince God reckons things done by his ſervants as theirs, when he doth it: Let all people that doe any thing for God, take heed of ſtroaking their owne heads. It is the errour of <hi>Rome,</hi> in doctrine, and in practiſe, they make mens good works meritorious, and make themſelves ſaviours: <hi>When we have done all we can, we are unprofitable;</hi> and God workes all good things in us, and all <hi>our works for us.</hi> That as <hi>Auſten</hi> ſaith, It is certaine, O God, he that reckons up his owne merits, what doth he reckon but thy gifts?</p>
            <p>We may have comfort and contentment in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and may glory in thoſe things that God hath given us in the temptations of Satan, but let us not aſcribe that to our ſelves, that belongs to God; for God begins
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:158707:60"/>the worke, and perfects it to his owne praiſe. So much for that. Now we come to the execution. <hi>Aaron</hi> did ſo, and upon the doing of it there came an innumerable company of <hi>frogs</hi> that covered <hi>Egypt:</hi> here obſerve,
<q>The wonderfull power of God, how ſpeedily and eaſily, and at what a diſtance he can worke.</q> 
               <hi>Aaron</hi> no ſooner <hi>ſtretcheth forth his rod,</hi> but this was done; he doth it ſpeedily. And hee doth but ſtretch out the <hi>rod,</hi> and all theſe creatures come abundantly. And he doth but put forth the <hi>rod</hi> toward the river. Saith <hi>Toſtatus,</hi> he was now in the Court of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> yet all this was done; therefore he workes at a great diſtance.</p>
            <p>Thus is the power of God remarkable in working quickly and eaſily, and at a great diſtance. I will not ſtand long on theſe things, becauſe in many paſſages we meet with it. God at the firſt made the world, and with a word; He ſpake the word, and all was made. Therefore thoſe Epicures and Atheiſts, that aske what ladder and engine he had to raiſe this goodly frame? they may be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by that in the Pſalme, <hi>He made them by his word:</hi> For as he ſpeakes in his workes; <hi>The heavens declare the glory of God;</hi> ſo he works in his ſpeeches. Nay, the very will of God, not only his word, but his will: <hi>I will, be thou cleane;</hi> not only <hi>ſpeake the word, and my ſervant ſhall be whole;</hi> but <hi>I will.</hi> How ſoone and how eaſily, and at what a diſtance did the Lord deſtroy the Army of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> in the red Sea? <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. So I might tell you of <hi>Sodome.</hi> Saith <hi>Tully</hi> the heathen, God can doe all things without labour and defatigation. Saith the old Poet, All things are eaſie to God; he knowes how to worke when he ſits ſtill.</p>
            <p>Therefore for the Uſe of it in a word: Let us ſtand
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:158707:61"/>in awe of God; if the Lord can ſo eaſily, and quickly, and ſpeedily, and at ſuch a diſtance worke, it is in vaine to contend and ſtrive againſt his power. God doth not need to fetch an Army of men to overthrow poore ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, he can doe it by <hi>frogs,</hi> by the leaſt creatures; by his word he can drowne the whole world. Well may we incline his mercy by our repentance; but certainly we can never doe our ſelves good by reſiſting.</p>
            <p>Secondly, never meaſure the worke of God by any diſtance. It was a fault in <hi>Naaman</hi> the Aſſyrian when he was to be cured of his leproſie, <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaid, <hi>Goe waſh in Iordan;</hi> ſaith he, I thought he would have come out, and have laid his hand upon the ſore; as if it could not be wrought without touching. So, it was ſome infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Ruler, <hi>Goe downe before my ſonne dye:</hi> As if Chriſt could doe nothing without he were preſent. So <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11. ſaith <hi>Martha, Lord if thou hadſt beene here my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had not dyed:</hi> As if God could not have prevented it at a great diſtance. The Lord is able to ſhew mercy from heaven, and to execute wrath as farre. Why doe we ſpeake of diſtance when the Lord is every where, and fills all places. No man is able to get out of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference where God is not. <hi>The Lord is preſent in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and doth what he will in heaven and earth;</hi> where, and how he will: there is no flying from his preſence; if a man goe to heaven, or to hell, or to the utmoſt parts of the ſea, there ſhall the hand of God finde him out. We come to another thing.</p>
            <q>And the frogs came up, and covered all the land of Egypt.</q>
            <p>Mark how God inlargeth the judgement; not one part of the land, but all the land was covered with theſe vermin.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:158707:61"/>God ſometimes ſmites a whole family, as we ſee in the family of <hi>Abimelech, Gen.</hi> 12. And God threatneth to ſmite whole families head, and foot, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. God ſmites ſometimes whole Cities, as we ſee <hi>Samaria</hi> had a famine, a fearfull one: and <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was vexed by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, that as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſaith, The children were taught a new way into their mothers wombe againe, they were faine to eat them for hunger. I, God ſmites divers Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties together, as the ſiſters of <hi>Sodome.</hi> Nay, God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proceeds to ſmite a whole Country. The ſinne of <hi>Saul</hi> was puniſhed in the dayes of <hi>Ahab,</hi> for three years the heavens were ſhut up till the bridle of heaven <hi>Eliah</hi> unlooſed them. So God viſited the whole world. I will not ſpeake of that great plague, that <hi>Evagrius</hi> ſaith, in his time there was a plague that continued in the world fifty yeares together; though it poſſeſſed not all the world at one time, yet ſucceſſively it went over all. We have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in Scripture, God overthrew the whole world by water; and will he not when he ſhall bring a deluge of fire at the laſt.</p>
            <p>The reaſon why God makes his judgements ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, is the generality of ſinne. Looke in all the inſtances I mentioned, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Abimelech.</hi> So in the City of <hi>Samaria</hi> that was puniſhed, it was full of ſinne; the greateſt ſinnes of all <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in that <hi>Metropolis: The ſinne of Iſrael is Samaria.</hi> The Prophet makes a ſad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> being the worſt. So that City of <hi>Sodome,</hi> you may eaſily ſee how ill they were that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited God for vengeance, that there were not ten righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous men found there, if there had, they had ſecured all. It was an epidemicall complaint, a generall diſeaſe. So we may ſay of the dayes of <hi>Saul,</hi> when there was ſuch a
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:158707:62"/>generall famine, it was for a foule ſinne. Nay, all the whole land was tainted. So in the dayes of <hi>Ahab,</hi> they were full of Idolatry and wickedneſſe: <hi>Eliah</hi> complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that there was ſuch a generall defection, that he ſaw none beſides himſelfe to ſerve God; though God told him of ſeven thouſand <hi>that bowed not their knees to Baal,</hi> yet what were theſe to all <hi>Iſrael?</hi> And in the dayes of the Prophets; and in the old world, the bloud and ſtain of ſinne, was ſo bad, that God knew not elſe how to waſh out that ſtaine. So at the laſt day, <hi>Iniquity ſhall abound;</hi> therefore God will bring fire to conſume them.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of this: <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>He went by the field of the ſluggard, and received inſtruction.</hi> Let us ſee how Gods judgements have ſpread. The deſtroying Angell hath been in all places, he hath not ſtricken all places at once; but he goeth further and extends himſelfe. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is a generality of ſinne. I would God, I had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to accuſe mine owne Nation of, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: But why ſhould I hold my peace when the ſinnes of the land proclaime themſelves as the ſinnes of <hi>Sodome?</hi> Who ſhall cenſure me or any Miniſter, for laying downe the cauſe of the plague? Looke on ſome ſinnes; how gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall is the ſinne of pride? A common ſinne that fills the land from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſheba,</hi> in every corner, even to <hi>her that grindes at the mill.</hi> Nothing will keepe people from vanity this way. How common is the ſinne of exceſſe? The ſinne of the Court, of the City, of the Country; and among the baſe Gadarens this Devill is entred into a herd of ſwine. It is come into the Country, and every roome ſmells of it. Nay, how doth this ſinne reigne in this City, that the Lords day is divided betweene the Tavernes and the Church? Nay, will you not ſay, that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:158707:62"/>the Devill goes with the better part. So for ſwearing, for oaths the <hi>land mournes.</hi> A common, generall ſinne, that unneceſſary vaine ſinne. The oaths of men, are like <hi>Ioabs</hi> ſword ever drawne out; men can ſcarcely ſpeake, but they muſt ſweare. A man can come into no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or place, but his <hi>righteous ſoule will be vexed with this blaſphemy againſt God.</hi> Nay, I would to God we could ſay, that perjurie were not growne to a great height, men have no care of oaths, though it were held ſacred among the heathen.</p>
            <p>What ſhall I ſay of uncharitableneſſe? It is a crying, groſſe, common ſinne; and a great number that ſeem to profeſſe Religion, that are moſt forward and zealous this way. The truth is, they are briniſh ſalt lights, that ſpit, and burne, and ſcald; they care not what dead flyes they caſt into this oyntment. It is far from the power of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the holy fire of charity.</p>
            <p>I could inſtance in a great number; but what ſhould I trouble you? By theſe you may gather that God hath a juſt controverſie with this Nation of ours, and the ſin being ſo generall; theſe <hi>frogs</hi> creeping in every corner, and croaking in every nooke; when God ſends his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in every coaſt, we muſt not but ſay, He his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing which I will conclude with, is this: This judgement, as it was the ſecond, ſo it ſeemes to be much greater then the former: for in the former judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there was but the turning of the nature of a thing, the turning the water into bloud; but here, there is a creating of an innumerable company of <hi>frogs.</hi> Againe, there ſome might eſcape; there is no other likelihood, but the Noble-men, and the King himſelfe, and many
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:158707:63"/>of ability might have wine, and other juices, and waters to ſatisfie their thirſt: but here, there was not a man in the Kingdome, but had <hi>frogs</hi> leaping upon him, and was annoyed by them in bed, and board. And as I told you the laſt day, the waters turned into bloud annoyed but ſome ſenſes, as the taſte, and the ſight; but theſe annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all. They were ugly to the eye by their deformity, to the eare by their croaking ſound; and to the ſmell they could not endure them: They ſpoyled their taſte, they came among their victualls; and for their feeling, as I told you, both <hi>Toſtatus,</hi> and others, ſay, they were ſuch <hi>frogs</hi> as were poyſonfull, and would doe miſchiefe, ſuch as our <hi>toads</hi> that we are afraid of. From all this, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a greater judgement then the former, obſerve this; that
<q>Where God ſeeth not amendment, he will make the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond judgement greater then the former.</q> God doth not ſo puniſh, but he can puniſh a man more, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.18. ſaith God, <hi>I will yet puniſh you ſeven times more. Veſichius</hi> upon the place, ſaith, It ſignifies that God would magnifie his power in laying the judgement more upon them. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.38. the people of God it is ſaid angred him, <hi>but he ſuffered not his whole diſpleaſure to ariſe. Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>If his wrath be kindled but a little, bleſſed are they that truſt in him.</hi> But if his whole diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, and breake downe in wrath, <hi>who ſhall ſtand? Rev.</hi> 6. He can make his jealouſie ſmoke, and breake out in a flame, and burne to the bottome of hell. There are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Gods wrath; ſo in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.12. <hi>David</hi> prayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the enemies of the Church, that God would pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them ſeven fold more, to lay more upon them.</p>
            <p>There were a great many judgements upon <hi>Iob;</hi> firſt,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:158707:63"/>he heard of his goods taken, and then of his ſervants, and then of his children, all oppreſſed by the ruine of a houſe. And was it not ſo with <hi>Elie?</hi> how did the ſtood riſe on him to a great height? Firſt, he heares of the diſcomſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Gods people, and then of the death of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and then of the taking of the Arke; which I know not whether it brake his heart or his necke ſooneſt. Can <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> heat his oven ſeven times hotter then before? and <hi>Rehoboam</hi> make his little finger heavier then his fathers loynes? Shall thoſe Lions that were ſo reſtrained, be the more furious? And cannot God grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his plagues, and inhance his judgements to the full? he can adde ſtill.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid by the Schooles, of the damned in hell, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be added in the extention of time; but for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, God could adde more, but that <hi>all his wayes are in mercie.</hi> Therefore if we be afflicted, ſay not that it is too much that God hath laid upon us, but wonder that it is no more. Doe not ſay with <hi>Rebecha, Why am I thus?</hi> as if God had dealt unjuſtly. <hi>Iob,</hi> he in a paſſion ſaid, <hi>O that my griefe were weighed;</hi> but in coole bloud, he laid <hi>his hand upon his mouth.</hi> He knew, that <hi>God was juſt and true in all his wayes, and holy in all his workes.</hi> Doth thy head ake? God could make thy heart ake. Haſt thou the tooth ake? God could have afflicted thee with the ſtrangurie, or with a violent burning feaver, that ſhould have put thee to nothing but frenzie and madneſſe: This God could doe: nay, it is Gods mercy that we are not conſumed, therefore doe not wonder why it is ſo much.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ever beware of continuance in ſinne. One judgement had paſſed <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and now another is on him. So all wicked ſinners if they ſtand out, and oppoſe
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:158707:64"/>God, and will not bow, God will increaſe their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments more and more. There are a great number in the world that thinke, if they have eſcaped the ſtocks once, and have got free from ſome diſeaſe, they have a <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedeas</hi> for a long time. It is a vaine perſwaſion, God deales gently, he firſt gives a jerke or two, the next time twice as many; and if that will not doe, the third time he ſets it on to purpoſe. God gives a ſippe of the cup, if that will not weane us from ſinfull pleaſures, then God gives us a great draught; and if that will not doe, we ſhall ſucke out the dregs. Thou canſt not conquer him, hee will bow thee, or breake thee. Thinkeſt thou that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt eſcaped one judgement, God cannot bring another? Oh, what treaſures of wrath hath God! Suppoſe now thou art freed from a diſeaſe, and doſt not make good uſe of that, God can give thee up to ſpirituall miſchiefe, to adde one ſinne to another. Thou wouldeſt not thinke this a judgement (it may be) but it is the worſt of all; for when God gives up a man to run further into ſin, it is a pit that they fall in that hate God: God is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with ſuch people out of all queſtion. And <hi>David</hi> had better have had the ſword in his family, then to have been given up from the committing of one ſinne to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And the ſin that the Iſraelites run into, it was worſe then the ſword of <hi>Balaak.</hi> You ſee in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. when God would puniſh the heathen to the full, <hi>He gave them up to their owne hearts luſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, if God give thee not up to this, cannot God ſmite thee with horrour of ſoule, with terrour of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, thoſe tempeſts of minde, as <hi>Ierome</hi> calls them? As one calls Chriſts ſufferings, thoſe unknowne ſufferings that none is able to relate but he that knew them. O, if
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:158707:64"/>God leave thee to diſmayed thoughts, and terrours, and helliſh cogitations, that ſometimes the ſoule hath; what will become of thee?</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe God quit thee of this, that thou come not into theſe brakes when thou offendeſt, if thou come to eternall torment, and God is able to doe that; all the afflictions of this life are nothing in compariſon of that, they are ſhadowes, that is the ſubſtance of all, for exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time. The afflictions of this world are but things that paſſe too and againe; and if it bee foule now and then, it may be cleare againe; but that judgement is a ſtanding poole, and a lake that continues firme, and ſhall for ever, when time ſhall be no more. Therefore now judge whether it be <hi>good to fall into the hands of the living God?</hi> He can ſmite thee with new plagues and diſeaſes, with new torments; or elſe he can give thee up to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate ſenſe; or elſe he can viſit thee with horrour of conſcience. And if thou eſcape all theſe, he can let thee go on in thy way till thou come to the place of torment; when thou ſhalt curſe the time that ever thou neglectedſt the day of thy viſitation. Therefore now let me be <hi>Peters</hi> Cock to crow, that if thou have forgotten thy ſalvation, and thy God hitherto: Now forſake thine iniquities, and thy evill wayes; or elſe looke for the improvement of judgements upon thee; and the plagues that come after, ſhall be greater then thoſe that went before. And no wonder if God heighten his plagues, when men advance in their ſins.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE come now to the event of this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The event is threefold.</p>
            <p>Firſt, here is the like done by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians, verſe 7.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the removall of this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the end of verſe 14.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the further obduration of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, verſe 15. that determines this judgement.</p>
            <pb n="117" facs="tcp:158707:65"/>
            <p>In the firſt of theſe, the practice of the Magicians; we may obſerve here,</p>
            <p>The work men; the Magicians:</p>
            <p>And their inſtrument (as I may ſo call it) their incan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and inchantments.</p>
            <p>And then the effect of their worke, and operation: <hi>They did ſo; they brought frogs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But concerning theſe Magicians, and their inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I ſpake ſomewhat formerly; therefore I ſhall ſay the leſſe now.</p>
            <p>I ſhewed then, how the Devill hath made uſe of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians, and inchanters in all times of the world, and that for his owne miſchievous reſpects.</p>
            <p>For firſt, hereby he hath perverted many noble and worthy Sciences; ſuch as Naturall Philoſophy, Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, Aſtrology, Arithmaticke, and Muſique; and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the edge of them againſt God, that founded and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them for his glory.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Devill hath wronged hereby, that that is the Queene of Sciences, Theology, while he hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted mens mindes from neceſary truths, and lead them captive to foule errours.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Devill, by meanes of magicke, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, hath fomented hereſies in the world. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no vaine obſervation, that the great heretiques of the primitive times, they were moſt of them Magici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, upon ſearch it will prove ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Samaria,</hi> called <hi>Niger;</hi> he was held to bee the great power of God; he made the people believe, he could flye in the aire, and that no army of men could apprehend him; and hee could make trees grow on the ſudden.</p>
            <pb n="118" facs="tcp:158707:66"/>
            <p>After him came one <hi>Menander,</hi> that <hi>Iuſtin Martyr</hi> ſpeakes of, he profeſt great matters: When he came to <hi>Antioch,</hi> he gave out that he and his diſciples ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dye; he had power to preſerve himſelfe from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ireneus</hi> ſpeakes of a foule hereticke that was a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, that would ſhew tricks; that would turne the wine in the Euchariſt, when it was white, he would make it red, and fill a greater veſſell with a leſſer; divers of thoſe pranks he played.</p>
            <p>So the Hiſtory ſaith concerning <hi>Baſilidas,</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> he was a Magician. <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſpeakes the like of <hi>Montanus,</hi> in whoſe hereſie <hi>Tertullian</hi> (though elſe a good man) was tardie. The people when they ſaw ſuch great works as theſe, they thought the doctrine muſt needs be of God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Devill hath gained much by this practiſe in the world; for he not only got admiration, but ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. When ſuch kinde of workes as theſe have been admired in a wondrous and unlimited manner, adoration hath followed to the perſon. The Devill would give all the world to <hi>Chriſt to fall down and worſhip him, Mat.</hi> 4. And he prevailed ſo farre with people as to ſacrifice their children to Devils, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.37. And it is well knowne by ſtories of the Indian parts, that moſt of thoſe people ſacrifice to the Devill, and worſhip him.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, the Devill, by magicke, and ſorcery, and witchcraft, hath not only begotten, but nouriſhed, and perfected many foule ſinnes in the world in practiſe. As luſt hath beene perfected through magicke ſpells, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments have beene uſed for the abuſing of poore people. Revenge hath been perfected through magick.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:158707:66"/>I thinke you will ſay by your owne experience, that moſt of the witches that ever have beene diſcovered, have beene ſo by malice. So ſometime it hath ſerved as a bawd to covetouſneſſe to bring wealth.</p>
            <p>All that I will ſay (becauſe I will not draw my Saw the ſame way againe) is to adviſe you in all things to keepe moderation; for it is eaſie for a man to goe too farre. Even in naturall Philoſophie, ſome people have ſo pored on the creature that they have turned Atheiſts. And in Aſtrologie, men have ſo overſotted themſelves, that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly, and concluſively, they have turned the courſes of men, calculated their nativity, and they will tell what death a man ſhall dye; as if they were of Gods privie Councell. Nay (Beloved) in Divinity it is poſſible for a man to tranſgreſſe his bounds, if he be not wiſe to <hi>ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Therefore it is good advice, let there be humility and ſobriety. A man may eaſily in the great deepe of Divinity, paſſe beyond his depth, his feet being carried away by the ſtreame. It is eaſie for the flye that flutters about the candle to burne her wings. Saith <hi>Nazianzen</hi> in his ſixteenth Oration, It were better for a man to bee ſluggiſh a little, then too curious, to ſeeke into thoſe reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſecrets that God hath kept ſecret. So much for that.</p>
            <p>I will ſay no more of the perſons, and of their inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but only one thing. It ſeemes that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſoon ſent for theſe people, when the judgement was on him. Theſe were the men that he truſted in, and he thinks to have eaſe by them; he will ſee what can be done. A man would have thought, he ſhould goe to God, and make his peace with him, to take off the edge of the judgement that way. But will you have it?</p>
            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:158707:67"/>
            <q>Carnall mindes in diſtreſſe when the judgements of God are upon them, their firſt courſe is to ſeek carnall meanes and comforts.</q>
            <p>That is the firſt thing: God is ſought in the laſt place. When <hi>Cain</hi> received his judgement from God, to be a runnagate over the face of the earth, to finde conſiſtence in no corner, he will ſee if he can diſappoint the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by building of Cities; as if he could lenifie his inward torment by his outward imployment. So we ſee it was with <hi>Saul,</hi> when he was troubled with an evill ſpirit; thoſe that were about him ſuggeſted that it was fit for him to ſeeke a man that was excellent in muſique, that he by his skill that way might helpe to condole his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed thoughts. There was no looking up to God to make his peace with him that ſent that judgement on him. So in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. when he was in diſtreſſe he runs to the witch at Endor, and ſhe muſt tell him the ſucceſſe of the battell. Thus it was with <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> he ſends to <hi>Baalzebub</hi> the god of Ekron, to conſult if he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover of his ſickneſſe. Thus it was with thoſe people in <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> when they were told that the Caldeans ſhould invade them, they caſt themſelves upon the hope of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia, and Egypt, and made account that they ſhould ſuſtaine them in their adverſity, and raiſe the ſiege of the other Army. So we ſee in the New Teſtament, when <hi>Iudas</hi> was ſtricken with horrour of ſoule, he comes back to the high Prieſts, thinking to finde ſome comfort there. Like to <hi>Belteſhazer,</hi> when he ſaw the hand-writing upon the wall; he ſends for his Aſtrologians, and other people that he put confidence in, and thinkes that they could helpe him out of the brakes. Nay, we finde this true by experience; let Gods hand be upon a man by a diſeaſe
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:158707:67"/>that is of an ill kinde, and threatneth the life, what doth he doe? In the firſt place ſaith <hi>Auſten,</hi> the Phyſitian is called for, and many great rewards are promiſed if hee be reſtored to his former latitude of health againe. In the laſt place, God is ſought unto, and it may be the Miniſter ſent for, and it may be that meanes would not be uſed, if the other were not deſpaired of.</p>
            <p>Nay, it falls out ſo in regard of the terrours on mens ſoules. Men that are troubled this way, what do they? Not ſeeke to make their peace with God, they ſeeke for humane comforts, worldly meanes. It may bee they will puzzle themſelves in a great number of buſineſſe. In ancient time, when their children paſſed through the fire to <hi>Moloch,</hi> they would drownd their crie with loud inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſo they thinke to ſilence the diſturbance of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience by buſineſſe. Others give themſelves up to all recreations when they have diſturbance of ſoule, to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſtories that are pleaſant, and to riding abroad, and whyling away the time with telling of tales, and by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves into company, and going to houſes of gaming. All theſe are thought to be excellent receits againſt ſpirituall qualmes. Some would faine lay theſe cares aſleep by drinking, and drowne them there. Thus there is no care had of peace-making with God. Men are not ſo ſenſible of the curing of the wound, only they deſire to helpe the aking of it. As a man that is in debt, he takes not care for the diſcharging of his ingagements; but all his ſtudy is, how he may keep out of the hands of the officers.</p>
            <p>For theſe, let them know that this is a very prepoſterous courſe, that only becomes ſuch as <hi>Pharaoh; For there is no evill in the City, but the Lord hath done is,</hi> therefore
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:158707:68"/>he muſt be ſought unto; and in the firſt place, it is well knowne, without him, all other outward comforts are unavailable. Let <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſend for his Wiſe-men, and do what he can, all ſhall not helpe him till God be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. If we have all the comforts in the world, they will prove inſufficient, if God put not warmth and life into them; therefore let us ſeeke him.</p>
            <p>Looke in all the examples before, and ſee how unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſefull all thoſe comforts were to wicked men. Did <hi>Cain</hi> finde reſt when he had built his City? he could not reſt, he was a vagabond for all that. Did <hi>Saul</hi> finde comfort in his muſique? The evill ſpirit had the inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon him now and then, and was fiercer. Had hee comfort by the witch of Endor? No, he made his wound deeper. And <hi>Ahaziah</hi> never came from his bed. So we ſee what poore comfort <hi>Iudas</hi> had, he was turned off with a <hi>Looke thou to it.</hi> So, thoſe that neglect to ſeek God in their ſickneſſe, they truſt to the Phyſitians like <hi>Aſa,</hi> and they never recover of their diſeaſe. And thoſe horrours of conſcience, when men ſeeke to ſilence their cares with delights and pleaſures, and recreations; it falls out as with a man in a hot feaver that hath taken a draught of cold water, when he hath dranke it, he thinks he hath abated the inward fire; but the cup is ſcarce from his mouth, but he complaines of the improvement of the burning diſeaſe. As money that is taken up for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of an arreſt it ſatisfies for that time, but it bites dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per after. A man that is neare drowning will catch at any reed, or ſtraw that floats upon the water, and thinks to helpe himſelfe by it; but they prove matter of entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Therefore the way for a men to eſcape this, is to goe
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:158707:68"/>to the Lord; get ſome of the bloud of Chriſt, that hee may ſpeed better; one drop of that is enough to ſatisfie the ſoule, and to cover all the heat, and fervour of it. Now let us take it into conſideration, and ever ſeek God in the firſt place; but wave all comforts and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the world till God be pacified.</p>
            <p>It is an Ironie that God beſtowes upon thoſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.37. <hi>Where are their gods, the rocke of their ſtrength?</hi> Let them riſe up and helpe them, and be their protection. So the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Call upon your gods now, thoſe that ye worſhipped, and ſee if they will helpe you in the time of diſtreſſe.</hi> None but God is a ſure refuge; and all the things of the world ſhall ſay to a man then, as the King of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> ſaid to the woman in the famine in <hi>Samaria, If God doe not helpe, how ſhall I helpe thee?</hi> So much for that.</p>
            <p>Now we come to the third thing, the worke it ſelfe, <hi>They did ſo,</hi> with the inchantments they wrought. Here ſome queſtions muſt be reſolved; every one of which, will yeeld ſome obſervations as we paſſe along.</p>
            <p>The firſt is this, made by <hi>Auſten</hi> in his queſtions upon <hi>Exodus,</hi> Can they fetch <hi>frogs?</hi> when fetcht they them? for all <hi>Egypt</hi> before was ſpread over with <hi>frogs,</hi> and by the touching of the waters, and the waters crawled abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, whence had they theſe <hi>frogs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly ſaith <hi>Hugo de ſancto,</hi> the Magicians muſt do it in other waters, or elſe it had beene no glory, for that abounded with <hi>frogs</hi> already.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Auſten</hi> for the reſolution of it refers us to that he had ſaid before. It is ſaid they were furniſhed with water out of Goſhen, that was not touched, and thence they raiſed thoſe <hi>frogs</hi> by ſmiting of Goſhen water.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay; would God ſuffer Goſhen to hee
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:158707:69"/>troubled? and the Magicians to have their will upon that place?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, not that it was any diſturbance to the people of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for without doubt their waters were kept ſweet, though they were touched by the Magicians. If <hi>frogs</hi> crawled out of them, it was to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to moleſt them; but in Goſhen it was done. We may obſerve this; that
<q>God ſometimes ſuffers the Devill to play his prizes upon his ground for his further confuſion.</q> As we ſee here. The Church, the aſſembly of Saints are holy, we know what reaks the Devill playes among them oft-times. The Altar of God was a holy place, yet <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litius</hi> brought his Idoll, and ſet it upon the very Altar it ſelf. As holy as our Lord himſelf was, yet he was carried by the evill Spirit from the pinacle to the mountaine: But God ſuffered it ſo to be for the further confuſion of that adverſary. God gives the Devill liberty, not only to invade the goods but the perſon of <hi>Iob,</hi> a holy man; that was high in Gods affection; yet God gave him power againſt him, only preſerve his life. So we ſee he ſuffers ſometimes his deareſt Saints to bee a kinde of Theatre for the Devill to play his priſes upon. As wee may obſerve ſometimes in blaſphemous thoughts caſt into the hearts of Gods deare children; not thoſe that are aſcending cogitations from the corruption of mans heart; but injected, caſt in by the Devill; darted into the ſoule like lightning, and come as thicke as haile: But theſe are to terrifie only, not to perſwade, as we may know by the experience of them, for they are againſt ſenſe and reaſon. Now all thoſe that ſuffer them may well be ſaid to ſuſtaine them, and not to doe them; they
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:158707:69"/>are meerly paſſive; whatſoever is done, is rather done upon them then by them: that muſt be their comfort, though they be exagitated in this kinde and troubled: God gives the Devill leave to play his priſes in his owne ground; it is for their greater comfort, and for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills confuſion: For I have ever obſerved thoſe people that have felt them in the greateſt meaſure have had ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſciences, and have beene more ſanctified in their lives and converſations ever after.</p>
            <p>So then (beloved) we muſt not thinke ſtrange if God ſuffer ſometimes this wicked one to play his priſes, hee doth it for the further confuſion of him; as for <hi>Iob,</hi> as <hi>Auſten</hi> ſaith, <hi>Iob</hi> was proved, and the Devill confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>The ſecond queſtion will be this, Why <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was ſo earneſt to have <hi>frogs</hi> brought? had he not enough of that judgement yet by that that <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> had done? All the land crawled, and they came up upon the body of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and into his bed-chamber, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted him to the full: what! would he have more <hi>frogs?</hi> Know,
<q>It is the property of way ward froward mindes, not to be ſo ſenſible of the ſmart of the judgement, as they are willing to illude it.</q> If a wicked man could, hee would not ſee God in a judgement, and take knowledge of him. Surely this was the humour of them in the dayes of <hi>Noah;</hi> when it rained abundantly in that manner, they were rather ready to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to naturall cauſes, then to ſee God in it; or elſe they would have waded to the Arke even to the middle, and have intreated entertainment there, rather then have ſtood out. So you ſhall finde it was with thoſe Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:158707:70"/>when Dagon was fallen, and broken in pieces, that they ſaw apparently, he was not able to helpe himſelfe; he was fallen in the preſence of the ſame Arke, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over which they aſcribed to their god; yet they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to miſchance, and to want of attendance; they would not ſee God in it. And in the ſame Chapter, when they were ſmote with Emerods for keeping the Arke, they continued ſeven months before they would ſee God in it, till there was an outcrie among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, none will acknowledge that God was the cauſe of that fearfull judgement. So we ſee the Aſſyrians had a great defeat by the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. yet rather then they would acknowledge God to bee the cauſe of it, they thinke it was the advantage of the place; if they fought with them in the valley they ſhould overcome them; for they thought God was only the God of the mountaines.</p>
            <p>So it was with the very Phariſees, rather then they would acknowledge Gods worke, in our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours great Workes of caſting out of Devills, (becauſe they can doe ſomewhat that way) they blaſpheme, and ſay, He caſt out Devills by the Devill. So oft in the world if a man have ſickneſſe, and diſeaſe, he thinks of the meat he hath eaten, and imputes it to the houſe, and to the aire; but never looks to God. So in diſtreſſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, when a man comes to trouble, and horrour of ſoule; he is loath to thinke other a great while then that it is melancholy; and thus he nouriſheth himſelfe in that vaine and idle conceit.</p>
            <p>Againe, you may obſerve, how
<q>A wayward, froward minde by his owne courſes, haſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his owne woe.</q>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:158707:70"/>
               <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would have concluſions tried by the Magicians, and behold, they bring more <hi>frogs</hi> then there were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. So a perverſe minde will ever doe miſchiefe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to it ſelfe. <hi>Sarah</hi> will be trying concluſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord did not grant her a childe in her owne time; but ſhe prayed for it; for ſhe was wonderfully troubled by the pettulancie, and inſolencie of her maid, and by the flearing and jearing of <hi>Iſhmael:</hi> Nay, and all her poſterity fared the worſe, for the Hagarens were great enemies to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> So it was with thoſe Iſraelites, they were paſſionate, they muſt have a King; nothing will ſerve them but the ſatisfying of their owne deſire, they were confident of their owne purpoſe; though they were forewarned of the difficulty and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, yet they muſt have it, though they repented at large. So <hi>Davids</hi> heart was ſet upon numbering of the people, <hi>Ioab</hi> modeſtly, and faithfully diſſwades him; it will not be; he reaped to himſelfe a great meaſure of repentance: ſo I might ſhew in other particulars. Let a violent minde alone to it ſelfe, and it will be torment e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to it ſelfe. Saith <hi>Auſten</hi> an inordinate minde is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a ſufficient tormenter.</p>
            <p>Let us ever take heed of perverſeneſſe and froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; theſe are ill guides, we follow that that will lead us to fearfull precipices. A man that is diſtempered, is ever apt to goe out at the wrong doore. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had more need to have deſired the Magicians to remove the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then to bring more <hi>frogs:</hi> But he deſired to have his humour ſatisfied this way, though it tend to his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther woe. So much for that queſtion.</p>
            <p>A third queſtion is, What kinde of <hi>frogs</hi> theſe were.</p>
            <p>Some ſay that they were true <hi>frogs,</hi> and that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:158707:71"/>brought them from other places ſecretly, and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, and ſo laid them there before <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> Beloved, there is no impoſſibility in this; for it is well knowne the Devill is of great power, he can tranſport the body of a man from place to place; then he can bring crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures quickly from one place to another. Many ſtrange things are told: <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> tells us of the rayning of many great creatures, that might be by the Devill: The ſtory tells us of <hi>Gigas,</hi> that was inviſible to people: It might not be ſo much by vertue of the ring as by the Devill. So he made Images to move, and to ſpeak. <hi>Arius Maximus</hi> tells us of the Image of <hi>Ionia,</hi> that when it was asked whether it would goe to <hi>Rome</hi> or no? anſwered, I. That Image of Fortune, that when they ſpake to it, ſhee anſwered, <hi>You conſecrate merightly.</hi> Certainly the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills power is great, and he is able to doe more then wee are able to expreſſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore (by the way) I would not have people ſleight his power too much. There are a great many people in the world, that make a tuſh of the Devills po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. We have heard in former times of Fairies and Hobgoblins, and walking Spirits; and they have learned ſo to contemne thoſe, that the Devill is no way terrible to them. But let them know what the Scripture ſaith concerning him, <hi>He is the Prince of the aire,</hi> and is able there to make ſtormes, and fearfull noiſe; he is able to make the ſea ſwell and roare, he is able to demoliſh the greateſt building, to pull downe trees, and plants that are fetled; he is able to afflict the bodies of men in a fearfull manner; you know how he poſſeſt ſome in the time of Chriſt; he made them cut themſelves with ſharp ſtones; be made them rent their fleſh, and teare and foame in a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:158707:71"/>fearfull manner; he caſt them into the fite and water, that if you have ſeene them diſtracted creatures in Bedlam, the caſe of thoſe that were poſſeſſed in Chriſts time was farre worſe. This is the power of the Devill. There is no tuſh to be made of it.</p>
            <p>Let us make better uſe of it, to bleſſe God for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation by his power, that he hath kept his good hand over us, that he could not have his will againſt us. For know, if the Devill might doe as much hurt as he would, it would be wofull for many of us; nay for all of us. This is our comfort ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> upon <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. he that tells us he is the <hi>ſtrong man,</hi> tells us that he is <hi>bound,</hi> God hath him in a chaine, he cannot doe more then he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits him, ſhall I ſay againſt <hi>Iob?</hi> nay not to the ſwine he cannot enter into them without our Lords leave, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us bleſſe God that hath kept his bleſſed hand of protection over us, and kept us from the violence of this roaring Lion.</p>
            <p>And (Beloved) as God hath graciouſly kept us from the power of the Devill, at leaſt from feeling the effects of his power; let us take heed of betraying our ſelves to him. This is an ordinary fault in regard of the ſoules of men. There is no ſinne in the world, that the Devill can ever faſten upon a man, if a man doe not give him enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. It is a certaine truth that the Fathers deliver unanimouſly. Saith <hi>Iſsidore Peluciota,</hi> the Devill may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, but he can never compell us. So <hi>Auſten,</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill hurts not by compelling, but by perſwading; and he makes a reſemblance of him there to a fell dog, or a filthy creature that is tyed up in a chaine; he may barke, but he cannot bite without a man come within his reach. If a mad dog be bound up, if a man be bitten he may
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:158707:72"/>thanke himſelfe, why did he come ſo neare? Saith the ſame Father, he cannot extort conſent from thee, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and intreat it. So <hi>Bernard</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, hee doth not overthrow us, he only moves us, and we give way, and ſo are authours of our owne woe.</p>
            <p>Therefore God having ſo graciouſly reſtrained him, we ſhould not caſt our ſelves into his clutches, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his power and malice againſt us, and againſt the hope of a better Kingdome.</p>
            <p>But I tell you in the next place the more common o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is, that theſe <hi>frogs</hi> were but ſuch in appearance. Thus the Father ſay, many of them. <hi>Iuſtin Martyr</hi> ſpeaking of theſe things that the Magicians did, ſaith di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, they were only the worke, the tricks of the Devill that abuſed the ſight of men, and deluded them. So <hi>Gregory Nycene</hi> in his booke of the life of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he ſaith, as their ſerpents were nothing but very ſhewes, ſo theſe other things that were done by the Magicians, were done by legordemaine, by couſenage. <hi>Auſten</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres,</hi> he ſaith, that all that theſe Magicians did was a fained emulation of that that was done by <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> and not in truth. So <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith, they imitated thoſe workes that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did, but they were not in truth. Now if we pitch on this, we ſhall have a good obſervation, and that is this; you ſee the great Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banke of the world;
<q>The Devill for the more eaſie conveyance of wickedneſſe into the mindes of men, you ſee how be imitates God in all his wayes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>God makes a covenant with his people; ſo the Devill he makes a covenant with Witches, and Sorcerers, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:158707:72"/>there is either an open or a ſecret contract ever. God hath his Sacraments, ſo the Devill hath his; he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth them with ſpells, and incantations, and other ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, at the uſe whereof he bindes himſelfe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. Thirdly, God ſpake to his ſervants by dreames; ſo doth the Devill, and inſtructs people in ſtrange viſions and apparitions.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, God hath his Temples, and Oracles ſo had the Devill, one at <hi>Delphos,</hi> and in other places to abuſe people by doubtfull anſwers.</p>
            <p>Againe, God had ſervice, and ſacrifice; ſo the Devill hath ſacrifices, what were all thoſe ſacrifices that were tendered to an imaginary god-head by the heathens? there was no ſolemnity ſpared. Nay, the Devill know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that God had commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſacrifice his ſonne, he cauſed ſome to make their children to paſſe through the fire. Still he continues to imitate.</p>
            <p>In the primitive times, he made the hereticks to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the orthodox in their teaching, and converſation, and ſo under a ſhew of holineſſe ſoured the world with their leven. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſaith of <hi>Iulian,</hi> that he was an Ape; for as an Ape imitates the man, ſo did he the Chriſtians in a humour. He would build Schooles and Hoſpitalls, places for the receit of the poore; and places for Nuns and Virgins, and all for the imitation of Chriſtians: whereas he was a Camelion, one that had no truth, nor ſincerity in him. And ſtill the Devill hath done the like.</p>
            <p>The authour of that imperfect worke of <hi>Chryſoſtomes,</hi> ſaith, that there is never a childe of God, that hath that in truth, but there be hypocrites in the world that have it in the counterfeit. If a man had ſeen <hi>Abſolom</hi> pay his
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:158707:73"/>vowes in <hi>Hebron.</hi> If he had ſeen <hi>Iezebel</hi> proclaime a faſt; and <hi>Herod</hi> talke with the Wiſe-men, that as ſoone as they heard where Chriſt was, they ſhould come and bring him word, to goe, and worſhip him; who would have thought but that theſe had beene themſelves? It was the Devill that painted theſe mud walls.</p>
            <p>So now, there is ſomewhat that goes for prayer in the world that is lip-labour. There is ſomewhat that goes for repentance that is not worthy the name of it, but is a ſorrow that <hi>is to be repented of.</hi> There is ſomewhat goes for zeale that is not a holy earneſtneſſe, but a fiery fury. There is ſomewhat that goes for faſting, that will not paſſe current in Gods Chequer, <hi>Is this the faſt that I have choſen?</hi> There is ſomewhat that goes for faith, that is preſumption, that is counterfeit: Yea there is ſomewhat goes for charity, and is nothing leſſe; for <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, a man may give all his goods to the poore, and yet have no charity.</p>
            <p>Then for the Uſe of this, (Beloved) what reaſon is there to get knowledge, to be able to diſcerne <hi>of ſpirits, to diſcerne of things that differ, to ſeparate between the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and the vile.</hi> We muſt not receive every ſpirit; all the ſpirits that come out are not of God: How ſhall this be done but by a good meaſure of knowledge? For the Devill can write upon the boxes, medicine, that have poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon indeed in them. The Devill can ſet a faire gloſſe upon falſe wares, no queſtion of that.</p>
            <p>Againe ſecondly, in regard of our ſelves, how ought we to labour for ſincerity? for if the Devill ſet men to counterfeit the beſt things, as he counterfeits the workes of God, how ſhould we labour for fincerity?</p>
            <p>And this will difference us from all the hypocrites in
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:158707:73"/>the world. The Painter can paint the colour of flame, and the bowing forme, but not the heat. So an hypocrite may goe as a Saint in outward performances; he may faſt, and pray, and communicate, and give almes, and what can he not doe? but when it comes to ſincerity of ſoule there is a broad difference; they are wide the whole heavens.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us labour to have our hearts upright, and then God will paſſe by many infirmities, where hee ſees ſincerity. Far be it from us of being ambitious of ſo much holineſſe as may make the world only believe that we are religious. It is the fault of many that reſort to the congregations to get an opinion. Let us not deſire to pleaſe men, but to love God, and to pleaſe him; our care being alway to pleaſe God, and not to deceive the world and couſen them. We may draw a miſt before their eyes eaſily to couſen them, they judge by our words, and workes, and cannot goe further, but God judgeth the heart. If he ſee us as the apples of <hi>Sodome,</hi> as a faire glove on a foule hand, and like the Sepulchres that Chriſt ſpeakes of, that within are full of rottenneſſe, we ſhall have the greater judgement.</p>
            <p>There be too many of theſe braggers, as <hi>Baſil</hi> calls them, thoſe that make a ſhew of what they are not. The time will come when God will waſh off this ſeeming with rivers of brimſtone. An hypocrite, certainly if there be any place lower in hell, he ſhall have it. So I have done with the third queſtion.</p>
            <p>One obſervation more (before I leave the verſe) that ſhal be profitable. Theſe Magicians reſembled the <hi>rod,</hi> &amp; brought <hi>ſerpents,</hi> and after turned the water into bloud; and now the third time they ſatisfie <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſo farre that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:158707:74"/>he thinkes that they were true <hi>frogs</hi> that they brought; ſo he ſeemed to ſtand out againſt the judgement of God for the time.</p>
            <q>See how farre God ſuffers wicked practiſes to proſper, and ſucceed the firſt, ſecond, and third time.</q>
            <p>There are many examples of this in Scripture. <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren, you know what they did to their brother, and how cleane they carried it away, after they had dipped his coat in bloud, and brought it to their old father; the poore credulous old man, he thought indeed a wilde beaſt had devoured him; and ſo they ſtand as upright in his opinion as before. This ſlept twenty years, they went cleare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> himſelfe had a minde to <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> he ſends for her, ſhe comes, and becomes pregnant by him; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to enjoy her without a rivall, her husband ſtands in the way, he ſends a letter, and cauſeth him to be ſlaine, every thing proſpers according to his deſire. So <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Iezebel</hi> ſhee gets letters written, and ſends to the Judges, they entertaine them, and ſubborne falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, <hi>Naboth</hi> is convinced, condemned, and ſtoned; <hi>Ahab</hi> comes and takes poſſeſſion; there is not a rubbe in all theſe ſmooth paths. So the accuſers of <hi>Daniel,</hi> they get the King to make an edict, to trap the good man, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing ſucceeds; they have not a rub till he comes, and was caſt into the den.</p>
            <p>We ſee in experience, the luſtfull man, here he layes a bait, and ſees a baſe fellow to be officious to him; his minde is ſatisfied as <hi>Amnons</hi> was upon his ſiſter. So with the covetous man, he that ſets it downe with a full reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that he will be rich; he takes theſe, and theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt courſes, they proſper and ſucceed; his ſhips come
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:158707:74"/>home, his merchandize come in, hee attaines that hee would have. So the ambitious man, he is officious with this courtier, and flatters, and ſoothes; with that he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends up by degrees all the rounds of honour, till hee come to be the only man. So the avengefull man, hee attaines his purpoſe as we ſee <hi>Abſolom,</hi> he makes no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, all is done, and he himſelfe ſhall not be detected by any body; they were willing to puniſh <hi>Amnon,</hi> and ſo he continues without repentance.</p>
            <p>Some man may aske the reaſon, how it comes to paſſe that theſe wicked buſineſſes ſhould ſucceed, and proſper, and goe on with incouragement?</p>
            <p>Firſt, God will ſhew mercy to the veſſells of wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. that wicked men may be inexcuſable when hee ſhall riſe to judgement, God ſhall ſay, <hi>I was long before I pulled my hand out of my boſome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the Lord doth it in juſt judgement, becauſe wicked men contemne his grace and favour, for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obduration of them. As in <hi>Rom,</hi> 1. <hi>when they turned the glory of God into the ſimilitude of a beaſt that eateth hay.</hi> God turned them up to their owne luſts, to be tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with their owne affections, and they received there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the recompence of their ſinne.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God doth this for the triall of his children. To goe no further then this inſtance; Was it not a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous probate of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aarou</hi> to ſee theſe men proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? what! the firſt, ſecond and third time to be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſefull. <hi>Moſes</hi> comes with this perſwaſion to the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that he ſhould doe thoſe ſignes in the fight of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that ſhould not only convince them, but incline them to a diſmiſſion of the people, and now to be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with a company of Inchanters. All their glory
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:158707:75"/>and authority lay upon theſe workes, and now for theſe to doe theſe, the firſt, ſecond and third time, how did this ſet backe the worke of God? For if <hi>Pharaoh</hi> were fomented in his obſtinacie, how could they expect deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance? this was a great probate of them, and God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of this, remember alway, that ſucceſſe is a poore ground to juſtifie an action upon. The heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man could ſay in his time, <hi>Felix, &amp;c.</hi> If one have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in wickedneſſe it is accounted a virtue. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> after he had robbed <hi>Eſculapius</hi> Temple, and had a faire wind, he thought that the Gods loved ſacriledge. And it may be <hi>Ieroboam</hi> loved Idolatrie the better, becauſe he heard of the Prophets puniſhment that was ſeduced, that ſpake againſt the Altar. And thoſe in <hi>Ier.</hi> 44. thought well of offering cakes to the Queene of heaven, becauſe they had all abundance. Like the argument that one makes for the reſtitution of the Idolatrie of <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a flouriſhing Commonwealth. Among <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> arguments, one of his notes of the Church is, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall felicity. The ſucceſſe of things is but a poore ground to goe upon; yet many men reaſon ſo in theſe times. As the worldly man will ſay that the Miniſter ſaith oft that God will plague ſuch and ſuch ſinnes as I know my ſelfe guilty of; yet I finde no checke of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, no man is able to controll mee, I proſper in my bames as well as another man, and my come is as thicke, and my line holds, my buſineſſe proſpers; I thinke that God is not ſo offended with me as ſome miniſters talke of. Many a man nouriſheth his heart as in a day of ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe of ſucceſſe.</p>
            <p>Poore deluded ſoule, that art conſcious to thy ſelf that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:158707:75"/>thy wayes are naught, and yet juſtifieth it becauſe of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. God is a patient and long-ſuffering God, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers people to goe on as he did <hi>Pharaoh</hi> into the middle of the ſea, and there cut off his chariots. He ſuffers them to goe a while, not that they ſhall alway proſper, but to make the cup more bitter after long proſperity.</p>
            <p>See it in all the examples before, ſee if they did not repent themſelves of that peace that they enjoyed. <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren carried it away ſmoothly; but God comes to a ſharpe reckoning in the concluſion; they were in a great agony, they knew not how to extricate themſelves. So <hi>David,</hi> he went ſmoothly for a time; but after it coſt him many a teare, he made his bed to ſwim. So <hi>Ahab,</hi> he wiſhed a thouſand times he had not meddled with the vineyard, the ſawce was ſo ſharpe with the meat. So <hi>Daniels</hi> accuſers they reaped the judgement they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt him, the Lions had power over them, they repented that ever they ſtirred that ſtone. So many co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous men in the world that have gathered goods by oppreſſion; his line holds for a time, it may be for his owne life; but who hath not ſeen the judgement of God on his poſterity, that a man may read the fathers ſin in the childes puniſhment?</p>
            <p>So the revengefull, the luſtfull, the ambitious man, God comes home to them, and ſo he will to others. Men may laugh, and rejoyce, becauſe of ſucceſſe, take heed, when the reckoning is paid; God will riſe in judgement, and then woe to thoſe that thrive in wicked wayes.</p>
            <p>It is the obſervation of a Father; all things are ſaid of the rich man, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. in the time paſt, <hi>There was a rich man, and he fared deliciouſly every day, and he was cloathed in purple, and thou haſt received all thy good.</hi> So theſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:158707:76"/>people, the time will come, when they ſhall be forced to ſay they had their profit, and their pleaſure here, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their deſire, and ſo they have had all that good that ever they ſhall have; they muſt be content with it, there is no more now, but an expectation of wrath, and miſchiefe, the cup of the Lord is full, it is mingled, the wicked of the earth ſhall ſucke the dregs of it.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, cenſure not Gods providence, nor juſtifie the wicked becauſe they thrive, and proſper in their wayes, and courſes, and deſignes, <hi>Fret not thy ſelfe for the wicked, Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>David</hi> was much taken with it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. he ſaith, <hi>That his foot had nigh ſlipped when he ſaw the proſperity of the wicked. Ieremiah</hi> deſired to diſpute with God upon this theame. The broad ſpreading bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree of the wicked moves emulation in the children of God; they thinke they have cleanſed their hands in vaine. But goe into the Sanctuary, and there you ſhall ſee that God hath ſet them in ſlippery places. Though their line hold here, yet thoſe lines tye them to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they ſhall be tyed as the vulture to the heart of <hi>Titius.</hi> Pity them, their woe is to come: Where is the children of God having had hardſhip in this world, ſhall have a bleſſed compenſation in the world to come.</p>
            <p>I ſhould come to the ſecond event, the removall of this judgement, I will only touch one thing in the front, and ſo commit you to God.</p>
            <p>It is like enough that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſent to the Magicians to know if they could remove the judgement, he found them unable, or elſe he would not intreat <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> to do it. Here is that that will make <hi>Pharaoh</hi> unexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable; for it hath beene queſtioned, whether <hi>Pharaoh</hi> were not excuſable in holding out againſt the command
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:158707:76"/>of God, and the commiſſion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe he was thus deluded by his Inchanters? For ſay they, how could he be perſwaded that <hi>Moſes</hi> came from God with a ſpeciall command, when his owne Inchanters did the like? ſo they extenuate his ſinne.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe they did it by as great power, and divine vertue as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and he had no reaſon to think that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were any better; yet this is unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable that they could not remove the judgement.</p>
            <p>So let men have never ſo many pretences, there is ſomewhat that will hold conſcience ſtill that it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give out of the hands of it: The conſcience will be hampered with ſomething; let the wicked man have ten thouſand Apologies, there is ſomewhat that will hold conſcience whereby it will be ſnared to judgement. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephs</hi> brethren can ſay much for themſelves for the ſlaughter of the Sychemites, that they did it in a way to vindicate the honour of their family; <hi>Should he uſe our ſiſter as a where?</hi> but there is one thing that makes it hold ſinne, the abuſe of the ordinance of God, to make it a midwife to deliver them of their ſinne. So <hi>Saul</hi> may make a fair gloſſe that he had ſpared the goods of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekites for ſacrifice; but there is one thing that holds him; what is that? that he had gone expreſſely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the command of God; for he bad him ſpare none. So <hi>Ahab</hi> had much to ſay for himſelfe, he came upon faire tearmes to <hi>Naboth</hi> for his vineyard, he offered him money, beſides he knew what <hi>Ahab</hi> was. But there is one thing that will have power over him; what is that? that his wife ſhould have power over his ſeale, to frame a letter to undoe the man. So the Scribes and Phariſees, they put it off, Did we perſecute this man? Wilt thou
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:158707:77"/>bring this mans blood upon us? we did it in zeale, hee ſeemed to oppoſe the law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> but one thing will hold them to judgement, becauſe it was malice in them againſt Chriſt, becauſe he reproved them ſo plainly that they could never claw it off.</p>
            <p>For the Uſe of it: Never thinke when you come to Judgement, of Apologies, and fig-leaves, that will be too narrow for your nakedneſſe; away with theſe ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges and ſtarting holes. God never brings a man to judgement, but he hath enough to judge him for, by the teſtimony of his owne conſcience, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> here, that when he knew it muſt be of God, yet he was hardened. The conſcience as it is a regiſter in man, at the day of Judgement, it will be an accuſer of man, and juſtifie Gods moſt ſevere proceedings againſt him. So much for this time.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow we come to the ſecond event, that is, the removall of the judgement. Wee muſt conſider,</p>
            <p>Firſt, how it is motioned, and intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for in verſe 8.</p>
            <p>Then how <hi>Moſes</hi> engageth himſelfe to performe it, verſe 9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, how he acts and performes it in deed, and puts it in execution, in verſe 12, 13, 14.</p>
            <pb n="142" facs="tcp:158707:78"/>
            <p>The firſt of them is in verſe 8. And there are two things in it briefly:</p>
            <p>A petition, and</p>
            <p>A promiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pharaohs</hi> requeſt is, That they would intreat God that he might be freed from theſe noyſome, fearfull <hi>frogs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His promiſe is, That he will let the people goe, and ſacrifice to the Lord. But firſt I will ſpeake of that that leads them in; that is,
<q>Pharaoh called for Moſes and Aaron.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is like enough that when the Inchanters had to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion brought forth <hi>frogs,</hi> that he ſleighted <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and diſmiſſed them, as if they were not the ſervants of a greater God then he worſhipped; for ſure he thought that theſe people that brought <hi>frogs</hi> to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, could alſo remove them. But now he begins to feele the ſmart of the judgement; it is likely, having conſulted with theſe Sorcerers, they cannot fit him this way. Now he cannot get from under the wrath of God, he calls for them. Our obſervation ſhall be this; that
<q>The time will come, that godly men ſhall be in requeſt with thoſe that deſpiſed them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>God will bring it about, that good, and godly people ſhall be in requeſt with thoſe that formerly deſpiſed and ſleighted them. Thus it was with <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and his Philiſtines, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.29. they vilified <hi>Iſaac,</hi> they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him and maligned him, and the wrath of them was ſo fierce that they drave him out of their Country; yet he was no ſooner gone, but the King and his Courtiers, they come after him, and deſire to make a league with him, and that he would be pleaſed to ſweare to them that he would doe them no harme; for they ſaw that he
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:158707:78"/>feared God, and that the hand of God was with him. The like we ſee in <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren; how did they contemne and deſpiſe <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and called him in ſcorne, The drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer? as if he had befooled himſelfe in thoſe preſages of his advancement; yet God brings it about that this man that they had ſo ſcorned, they were faine to ſue to him, <hi>forgive the treſpaſſe of the ſervants of thy fathers God, in that we have done fooliſhly, Gen.</hi> 50.17. The like we ſee in <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 32. how he was ſleighted and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Iſraelites; <hi>As for this Moſes, we know not what is become of him.</hi> But they ſpake of him in a low ſtile; yet after a while, when the judgement of God was upon them, they were faine to flye to him as their beſt refuge on earth, and deſire him to mediate a peace. So in <hi>Exo.</hi> 12. <hi>Aaron</hi> joynes with <hi>Miriam</hi> in emulation againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſpeake of their brother in diminution; but after <hi>Aaron</hi> intreats him not to lay that ſinne to their charge that they had committed fooliſhly, and ſuffered his ſiſter to be a reproach to the world. The like we ſee in <hi>Iephtah,</hi> he was put out of his fathers houſe, and contemned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was the ſonne of an harlot, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 11. yet when they were infeſted by their enemies, they were faine to ſeeke to him, and intreat him to be their Captaine. So we ſee in <hi>Saul,</hi> you ſee how he ſcorned <hi>David,</hi> he would not ſo much as call him by his right name: <hi>Where is the ſonne of Iſha that he doth not come to meat? And will none of you tell me that my ſonne, and the ſonne of Iſha have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired againſt me?</hi> Yet he that he contemned he bowed to when he had him in the cave, and gave pregnant proof of his loyalty, he deſired him that he would be good to his poſterity, and not cut them off. So it was with <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. he ſtretched forth his hand in contempt
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:158707:79"/>and hatred (I joyne them together) againſt the Prophet, and that hand that he ſtretched out, he could not draw in againe; and then he was faine to intreat the Prophet that he would intreat the face of God that his arme might be reſtored.</p>
            <p>So we ſee in <hi>Heſter, Haman</hi> put her in the ſame Barke with all the Jewes; and it is like enough in that reſpect and name, becauſe ſhe was a Jew he diſeſteemed her; after he was faine to ſue to her for his life, that ſhe would mediate with the King that the edge of his wrath might be taken off, <hi>Heſt.</hi> 7. And <hi>Ieremiah</hi> that was ſo much deſpiſed by <hi>Zedechiah</hi> and his Princes; that <hi>Zedechiah</hi> was faine to ſue to him that he would pray for him, <hi>Ier.</hi> 37.3. And not to multiply more, you know how much the rich man ſcorned the poore beggar; yet the time came that being in hell, in torments, he begged a boone of him, that is, that he might be ſent with a little water to coole his tongue, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.24. And this is that <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> hath <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.19. <hi>The bad ſhall how before the good, and the wicked at the doore of the righteous.</hi> There is a bowing that wicked men make ſometimes to the good, that <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes off, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. they crouch and creep, and humble themſelves, and all to impoſe upon the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of the righteous, and the ſooner to inſnare them. But <hi>Solomon</hi> his ſonne, ſpeakes of another bowing, when the wicked are forced by Gods overruling providence to ſupplicate and ſue to the children of God to deſire their friendſhip, and mediation, and interceſſion, that they deſpiſed and maligned before.</p>
            <p>What may be the ground of this?</p>
            <p>Firſt, God hath planted an awfulneſſe, and majeſty in his children that makes them venerable to the wicked
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:158707:79"/>ſometimes. I ſpeak not of ſuch a ſplendor as <hi>Moſes</hi> had that the Jews could not look on for the glory of his countenance. I ſpeak not of ſuch a glory as Chriſt had, that <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith was ſtarre-like, that drew the people to ſee him. Nor ſuch as hee ſpeaks of <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> that had ſuch a ſplendor that <hi>Maximianus</hi> was afraid to look on him, leſt hee ſhould make him turn Chriſtian. Nor ſuch as <hi>Steven</hi> had, God made that Diamond ſo ſparkle in the dark, that they beheld his face as the face of an Angel.</p>
            <p>But I meane, there is an awfull authority that God hath put upon his children, that makes the wickeds eyes dazzle. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Wiſedome makes the face of a man to ſhine: Cajetan</hi> underſtands it of that authority that God hath planted in his Children that makes them awfull to thoſe that are wicked. All the people feared <hi>Samuel</hi> exceedingly, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.18. and it is ſaid that wicked <hi>Herod</hi> feared <hi>John,</hi> becauſe he was a holy and a juſt man, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.14.</p>
            <p>Againe, ſecondly, God doth this to make his word true: for hee hath ſaid, <hi>Hee that humbleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſhall bee exalted, and hee that exalteth himſelfe ſhall bee humbled.</hi> Now the children of God oft put their mouthes in the duſt; they are low, and humble, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God will take a time to exalt them. As <hi>David,</hi> hee carryed himſelf humbly, and how ever ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracters diſ-figured him to his Prince, he never ſpake of him without reverence: therefore God exalted him, and ſo exalted him that hee did bring the proud ſpirit of <hi>Saul</hi> to ſue to him. So <hi>Mordecat,</hi> hee was a humble man, he ſate in the gate, he was content with his condition: God exalted him, and how did hee
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:158707:80"/>make that proud ſpirited <hi>Haman</hi> to ſtoope ſo low as to advance him?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God thinks fit to make his Children a compenſation in the ſight of men; They are brought to that ſtraite ſometimes that they are faine to ſue to the wicked. <hi>Jacob</hi> was ſo perplexed for want of bread, that hee was faine to ſend to <hi>Aegypt</hi> for corn, and was faine to pacifie his brother and to ſend pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent before him, to humble himſelf, and to fall to the ground ſo many times before hee came at him. And in <hi>Lam.</hi> 5.6. they gave their hands to <hi>Aſsyria,</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> for bread: thoſe that were their mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they were fain to comply with them for bread. As I ſaid of <hi>Heſter</hi> before; ſhee ſued for her life. Now then the good God that they ſerve, to make them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, brings the wicked to ſue to them. As they are forced to ſue to the wicked ſometimes for reliefe in their neceſſities; ſo the wicked ſhall ſue to them.</p>
            <p>It may be ſhewed in all the examples before alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And likewiſe in <hi>Jobs</hi> kinſmen, though they inſulted over the miſerable poore man, and cenſured him at their pleaſure, yet after they were faine to ſue to <hi>Job,</hi> and God would not bee reconciled to them till hee had ſued for them.</p>
            <p>For the uſe of this. Firſt, me thinks it might take off the edge of wicked men, in regard of the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe that feare God. For a man hath ſo much underſtanding that hee will not irritate, and provoke ſuch as hee thinks hee ſhall bee beholden to after, for feare the ſuite of his need bee repelled with the errour of his proſperity; yet ſuch is the madneſſe of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to bee diſcourteous, and injurious moſt to thoſe
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:158707:80"/>that they are like moſt to bee beholden to. I know their proud ſpirits ſcorne the thought of ever being beholden to the children of God. Yet ſo God brings it about, though it may bee they will not ſue to them; yet though their blindneſſe will not let them ſee, or their unthankfulneſſe to acknowledge it, yet they bee beholden to them. For <hi>Lot</hi> bayled <hi>Sodome,</hi> while hee was with them. If <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtand not in the gap, fierce judgements come among the proud people. If theſe pillars beare not up the houſe, it will fall about their eares. If theſe ſtakes doe not hold the hedg, they are laid open to all miſery <hi>Auguſtin in lib. de Civ. Dei.</hi> Hee wonders that a company of people that eſcaped in the ſacking of a City, by profeſſing themſelves to bee Chriſtians, that they ſhould perſecute Chriſtians afterward, when they had been beholden to the name of Chriſt for their eſcape. And who would not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the madneſſe of the world, that perſecute thoſe that they may bee, and are beholden to daily? and thoſe bee the people of God, by whoſe interceſſion they eſcape judgements.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it ſhould teach the people of God,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Direction, and</p>
            <p>Then Comfort.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Direction; let them make much of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and love it with the inſide of their hearts: for this is that that will not only commend them to God, but make them awfull to the wicked. This is that that will make one of the Children of God weigh down a thouſand of the ſons of <hi>Beliall.</hi> This is that that will make them gold, when the wicked ſhall bee accounted droſſe. It will make them good Come,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:158707:81"/>when the wicked of the earth ſhall bee chaffe, it will make them herbes, and flowers when the wicked ſhall be weeds, fit for nothing but to be burned.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for their comfort, though they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned by a great number of prophane ones, the time will come that God will exalt them: hee will make the wicked to bleſſe their condition, and it may bee ſeeke to them. For if ever God bring a wicked man to terrours of ſoule, he magnifies the eſtate of a good man, and thinks he is the happieſt man in the world; he wiſheth a thouſand times that he were in his eſtate: and when the Angel of God meets him as he did <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> betweene two walls, that hee can goe no way from him, (I meane when death comes) hee deſires to die the death of the righteous, and that his laſt end may be like his. And then he ſues to the righteous man to pray for him, and intercede at the throne of grace.</p>
            <p>If this be not enough for comfort, know that you ſhall judge theſe wicked ones, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Doe yee not know that the Saints ſhall judge the world?</hi> If that bee not enough, the wicked ſhall ſee the Children of God exalted, and ſhall gnaſh their teeth, and conſume away; and ſhall ſpeak as they in <hi>Wiſdome, We tho ught his life madneſſe, and his end horrour, and loe he is preferred before us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, to ſpread it further, let it be a comfort to all miniſters, that are to the people as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> here were meſſengers to <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> It is likely they may receive diſgrace and diſparagement, as if the worke were but an unjuſt worke. Who is ſo forward to perſecute the ſonnes of God as the ſonnes of <hi>Belial?</hi>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:158707:81"/>Let this comfort them, for if they continue in their courſe, and preach ſound doctrine, and live an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable life, God will make theſe ſtoope one day. The people for all their contempt of <hi>Samuel,</hi> they were faine to intreate him to pray for them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. And thoſe that flouted them in <hi>Act.</hi> 2. they were faine to come for direction, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall wee doe?</hi> And the Gaoler that clapt the Apoſtles in Irons, when there was an earthquake, and the doores of the priſon flew open, and every mans bonds did flie from him, he comes trembling, and will doe any thing. And as <hi>Theodoret</hi> reports of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his paſſage to <hi>Theodotius;</hi> though the Courtiers bad him ſlight that hee did, hee could not put it off; hee was faine to ſend, he was faine to ſubmit to the penance. So the world, let them ſlight the Miniſters of God as they will, the houre will come, they will be caught in their moneth, and then it may be they will deſire directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and their prayers. At the laſt, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> muſt call for <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> So much for that.</p>
            <p>Now I come to his Petition,
<q>Intreat the Lord that he may take away the Frogs from me, and from my people.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It ſeemeth then that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was enlightned to know theſe three things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that God muſt remove the judgement.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that he muſt be intreated for the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that he muſt be intreated by his ſervants; theſe are but ordinary points, therefore I will paſſe them over the more briefly.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he underſtood that God muſt remove this
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:158707:82"/>plague, the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> muſt doe it; indeed it is his worke. For as no judgement can ſeize on men without a commiſſion from him, <hi>Thou couldeſt have no power,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Pilate,</hi> unleſſe <hi>it were given thee from above:</hi> So it is not in the power of fleſh to move the leaſt Flie from a mans body, till God pleaſe. It was hee that ſtayed the waters and abated them on the face of the earth when the deluge ceaſed. It was this God that opened the wombs of <hi>Abimelechs</hi> fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. It was this God that ſaid to the Angel when hee forraged the Campe of <hi>Iſrael, It is ſufficient,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. It is this God that ſtayes the famine, and cauſeth the Sword to returne into the ſheath, that would ſtill eate fleſh, if it were not for his command. That God that hath ſaid to the Sea, <hi>Hither ſhalt thou come,</hi> and <hi>here thou ſhalt ſtay thy proud waves, Job.</hi> 30.11. it is that God that remits, and reſtraines, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, and takes away, and removes all judgements whatſoever. The roaring Lion he takes off, and puts an end even to ſpirituall temptations.</p>
            <p>The Uſe ſhall be double:</p>
            <p>Firſt, To teach us to whom to have recourſe in the time of trouble; not to run with <hi>Saul</hi> to the witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> or with <hi>Ahaziah</hi> to <hi>Baalzebub</hi> the God of <hi>Ekron,</hi> from the living to the dead. This will not help; he that wounded muſt heale, and he that ſmites muſt bind up, and that is the Lord himſelfe: it is he onely that muſt take away the judgement. <hi>Rachel</hi> may bee fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and chide her husband, and be diſcontented; it is all one: God muſt remember her and open her wombe. The woman in the Goſpel may ſpend all upon Phyſitians: but God muſt ſtint her infirmity, ſhe
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:158707:82"/>muſt touch the hem of Chriſts garment. If God do not help, ſaith the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the woman in the Siege of <hi>Samaria, how ſhall I help?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It ſhould teach us to whom to give thanks for deliverance from trouble, even to the Lord. To this God <hi>Noah</hi> built an Altar for the ceaſing of the deluge. To this God <hi>Jacob</hi> built an Altar for his preſervation from the fury of his brother. To this God <hi>David</hi> built an Altar in the threſhing floore of <hi>Araunah,</hi> for the ceſſation of the plague. To this God let us give thanks, and ever glorifie his name, that hath ceaſed the famine; and hath put a period to the plague that formerly did break out in this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. To thee, O God, the praiſe is due, give us leave to take the cup of Salvation, and glorifie thy name.</p>
            <p>Even the heathen have done thus much, they had their gifts, that they offered to theſe, and theſe dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that they imagined were the means of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and their pillars have this inſcription up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Freelier muſt this be acknowledged ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by Chriſtians, if not, it is the next way to make the judgement the ſame, or greater, to forrage them with greater fierceneſſe, and bitterneſſe. If Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour be not acknowledged, no wonder if judgements afflict us. If <hi>Iſaac</hi> be ſpared, it is reaſon a Ram ſhould be offered.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he ſuppoſed that God muſt be intreated. The Religion of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> taught him that thoſe dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that he ſerved muſt be ſupplicated. And you ſhall find in prophane writers that the Pagans thought there was nothing to be had of their Gods without ſupplication, and ſacrifice. Therefore it muſt ever be
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:158707:83"/>acknowledged by Chriſtians, that God having ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied prayer, and ordained it to be the bucket of grace to let downe to the over-flowing fountaine of Gods favour; to bee the key of the treaſure that opens to thoſe precious things; to be the dove that fetcheth the Olive leafe of peace, ſurely ſpare to ſpeake, ſpare to ſpeed.</p>
            <p>What though God know our neceſſities before we utter them? wee are not informers of God, but petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners. Thou doſt not ſpeake to God, and tell him thy wants to teach him, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome:</hi> but that thou mayſt incline him to heare thee. Our bleſſed Lord hath ſaid, <hi>aske and it ſhall be given you.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſaid, though he knew Gods propenſitie to give, <hi>Let your requeſts be made knowne with ſupplication, and giving of thanks, Phil.</hi> 4.16. Therefore, though God know our wants, yet in obedience to Gods ordinance, let us tender our prayers.</p>
            <p>What though God determine before wee aske to give it? this keeps not us from praying: as God hath ordained the end, ſo hee hath ordained the meanes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.11.12. God ſaith, <hi>I know the purpoſes and the thoughts I have for you, the thoughts not of trouble but of peace.</hi> But what follows? yet, ſaith hee, <hi>they ſhall pray and cry to me.</hi> As if he had ſaid, though I have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, I will have you to teſtifie your dutifulneſſe in prayer: ſo in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.36. God ſaith how hee will determine the Captivitie of his people, but <hi>for this I will be intreated of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> Hee will be called on. See an example in <hi>Daniel,</hi> that though hee knew ſomewhat out of <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> propheſie that the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie ſhould bee determined at 70. yeares, yet hee
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:158707:83"/>prayes to God, and ſolicites that he would pleaſe to remember it.</p>
            <p>Thirldly, whereas ſome people ſay, if wee muſt pray for the removing of judgments, how ſhall wee make good our patience under the croſſe?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, patience, and prayer are compatible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. See in the example of <hi>David,</hi> who though he were a man full of patience, and ſaid, <hi>Here I am, let God do with me what he will:</hi> yet for all that, he deſired God to take away his ſtroak. And that great exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and patterne of all patience, our bleſſed Lord, yet he cryed out, <hi>Let this cup paſſe from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the uſe of it, if God muſt bee intreated for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, be ſure to take that courſe, be ever willing to put into that way that God hath chalked out for the obtaining of his favour. Prayer is an admirable thing, and <hi>Luther</hi> doth not ſtick in one place to call it omnipotent: it is very acceptable to God, <hi>Let mee heare thy voyce, for thy voyce is ſweet,</hi> ſaith the Husband to the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. And <hi>the prayers of the Saints are Odours, Rev.</hi> 5.8. And to ſum up all, it is that that God hath appointed to bee the meanes to convey bleſſings: therefore he that waves Gods direction, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, may well fall ſhort of his expectation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he underſtood that God muſt bee intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his ſervants, he deſires them to pray for him. God ſaith to <hi>Abimelech, Abraham</hi> is a Prophet, and he ſhall pray for thee; So <hi>Iob</hi> prayed for his friends, ſo the man of God for <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt intreat for thoſe that had offended againſt God, and had been contumacious; God loves the prayers of his own, <hi>God heareth not ſinners,</hi> that is,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:158707:84"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:158707:85"/>thoſe that wallow in wickedneſſe, and lie prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ſame, with reſolution, God indures not ſuch that they ſhould take his word into their mouths, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they hate to be reformed, their very ſacrifice is abominable.</p>
            <p>But how far forth the children of God have inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in him, and ſway with their petitions, wee ſhall further ſhew when wee come to that paſſage, where <hi>Moſes</hi> ingageth himſelf that the judgment ſhall bee removed upon his prayer. And ſo I come to another obſervation.</p>
            <q>Intreat for me, that the judgment may be removed from me, and from my people.</q>
            <p>Why <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> why doſt thou not intreat that the judgement of hardneſſe of heart may bee removed? O why doſt thou not pray to <hi>Moſes</hi> to intreat God to give thee a ſupple ſpirit, that may be apt, and fit, and pliable for the impreſſions of grace? doſt thou not yet confeſſe thine iniquitie? doſt thou not yet repent that thou haſt ſtood out ſo long againſt the Lord of Hoſts? If thou wert ſenſible of this judgment of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duration, it is greater then the turning of the waters into blood, and then theſe Frogs, or any judgment that was after inflicted. Well, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with this; Therefore to come to the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; you ſee what the humour of wicked people is, they are more affected with the puniſhment then with the ſinne. Remove the judgment, O let the Frogs be gone; he ſaith not, Remove my ſinne, take away this heart, and give me a new heart.</p>
            <q>The wicked are more affected with the puniſhment then
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:158707:85"/>with the ſin, and deſire more that their bodies ſhould be eaſed then their ſoules cured.</q>
            <p>See it in <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4. he cries out, <hi>My puniſhment is greater then I can beare.</hi> The word there uſed ſignifies oft in Scripture, ſinne; yet ſometimes alſo puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: divers of the Greek, and Latine Fathers tooke it as if hee complayned of his ſinne, that it was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then could be forgiven, and ſo make it an evidence of his diſtruſt, and diffidence, and deſpaire; but our tranſlation renders it, <hi>My puniſhment is greater then I can beare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely, he that obſerves the words following ſhall eaſily conceive that it was not the ſin that troubled him: but the ſenſe of this; I ſhall be a vagabond, and a runnagate, and every man that meets me ſhall kill me. That troubled and diſturbed him, not that hee had offended God, and expoſed, and made himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the curſe of God; that was not it, his ſin did not trouble him, but that this judgement ſhould fall upon him.</p>
            <p>So the like wee ſee in <hi>Eſau,</hi> hee mournes, and weeps, and howles, and keeps a ſtir, but it was onely in the ſenſe of loſſe; not for the prophaneneſſe of his heart, but for the loſſe he thought hee ſhould ſuſtaine, in that his brother was preferred before him; it was ſome diſparagement, and diſgrace to him. Surely he mourned not for his ſinne, becauſe at the ſame time he reſolved to kill his brother. If he had mourned for his ſinnes, hee would never have reſolved on ſo cruell an act.</p>
            <p>So in <hi>Saul, Samuel</hi> expoſtulates with him, he was not ſo troubled with his finne, as with the renting of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:158707:86"/>the Kingdome from him, and the ſhrinking of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in the world, <hi>Honour me before the people,</hi> ſaith hee. So <hi>Ahab,</hi> hee puts on Sackcloth, and makes a humiliation, God knowes, for the judgement more then for the ſinne; for wee ſee after how ready hee was to impriſon <hi>Micaiah:</hi> So <hi>Simon Magus</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 8. after <hi>Peter</hi> had threatned him ſeverely, <hi>O pray for me that none of theſe things come to me that you have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi> Saith <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> a man would thinke that this were a man that ingenuouſly confeſſed his ſinnes: but ſaith he, it came not from a good reſolution. And ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> it came not from his heart: <hi>for hee was ſtill polluted in the gall of bitterneſſe, and the bond of iniquitie.</hi> Therefore the thing he feared was judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Pray that theſe things may not come upon me;</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the judgment that <hi>Peter</hi> had threatned.</p>
            <p>And this is that ſpirit of bondage, that ſervile ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>You have not received the ſpirit of bondage to feare againe.</hi> This ſpirit of bondage is in the wicked the feare of a ſlave, that is not ſo much troubled with the offence of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, as with the whip, and laſh that ſhall light on him. A wicked man is not ſo much troubled with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing of God, as with burning with the devill in hell.</p>
            <p>I deny not but there may be great uſe of this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile feare, even in Gods owne; for when God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts a man, hee makes uſe of this ſervile feare to breake downe thoſe ſtrong holds, thoſe fortifications that the devill hath built in a man to keep out God: by improving the Law that is as Cannon ſhot, hee breaks downe this ſtrong building. Therefore <hi>Auſtin</hi>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:158707:86"/>ſaith, this ſervile feare is good and profitable; like the briſtle, or needle, that though it ſew not the cloth, it makes way, it keeps the heart ſupple for the impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of grace; and out of doubt, God terrifieth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he comforts.</p>
            <p>Nay, in growne Chriſtians, there is great uſe of theſe ſervile feares, (I meane) to feare the judgments of God: for I find it in Gods Saints, <hi>Joſias</hi> heart mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the threatnings of the Law, and <hi>David</hi> was afraid <hi>becauſe of Gods righteous judgements. Habakkuk</hi> ſaith <hi>that his belly trembled, and his lips did ſhake, and rottenneſſe entred into his bones, when hee thought of the judgements of God:</hi> And I deſire that the remembrance of hell may keep my ſelfe and others from ſin.</p>
            <p>But I ſay, that is not onely the worke in Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; I know that puniſhment makes them not good. But there is likewiſe the love of God, which though it appeare not ſo fully to every body, God diſcernes it. And out of doubt Gods children though they were in hell they would bee afraid to offend God out of love. And when judgements are inflicted on the Children of God, their chiefe care is to make their peace with God: for the putiſhment they reſpect it not ſo much; they are content to have the judgement lie ſtill, ſo they may receive peace, and aſſurance of reconciliation. As <hi>David,</hi> when the hand of God was upon him for numbering the people, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. O ſaith he, <hi>forgive the treſpaſſe of thy ſervant.</hi> That is the firſt thing he deales with God for, to forgive his iniquitie, his impietie; for the judgement he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, <hi>Let thy hand be on me, and on my fathers houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the uſe, it is a note of tryall, and examination.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:158707:87"/>There are divers loſſes, and croſſes fall upon us: ſometimes we ſuffer one way, ſometimes another. It may be God viſits us with ſickeneſſe, and layes us on the bed of ſorrow, what doth preſently, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally touch us? what doe we ſpend our teares and ſighes and prayers on? Is it to make our peace with God? Is it ſinne that troubleth, and diſturbes us? Is that it, or is it onely to get from under the flame, and to get, as <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith, from the furnace of tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> calls it? Is the trouble of the fleſh onely a vexation to us? Is it ſo that when we runne our ſelves into courſes that may make us ſhamefull, that all our chiefe care is to patch up our credite with the world, with the neglect of our peace with God? If it be thus, it is fearefull, for what are all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and diſeaſes of the body to the maladies of the ſoule? What are all the good words, and honours of the world to the peace of a mans owne conſcience?</p>
            <p>The Prophet ſpeaks of ſuch in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.14. <hi>that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on their beds, and cryed to God for Corne and Oyle, but rebelled againſt God.</hi> So there are a number of people that are very paſſionate if they want proviſion, but they care not for their tranſgreſſions, if they could get from under the trouble their ſinnes would never afflict them.</p>
            <p>But in the feare of God, let us labour to come to this; to feare to ſinne, rather then to ſmart for ſinne. And if it were poſſible to come to that height that we might ſay, if there were ſinne on the one ſide, and hell on the other, and torment; we had rather fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell then to commit ſinne; it is a great pitch.</p>
            <p>Let us labour when the hand of God is on us at
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:158707:87"/>any time, though it diſturbe fleſh and blood, let us know that the maine thing that ſhould trouble us is our ſinnes, and preſently make our peace with God: and if wee have done that, wee ſhall have the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affliction removed, or ſanctified, we ſhall find hony in that Lion; wee ſhall have the waters of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> made ſweet to us; and it may bee God will bring it about that we ſhall rejoyce in tribulation. So much for that.</p>
            <q>Remove this plague from me and my people.</q>
            <p>Though there were many bad things in this wicked <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> yet here is one Berry, which though it bee in the utmoſt bough, I will not neglect.</p>
            <q>From me and my people.</q>
            <p>The care hee had that his people ſhould bee free as well as himſelfe: Surely,
<q>It is that that becomes Princes and Governours, to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the neceſſities in which their people are.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There bee many reſemblances uſed that prove to us the truth of this. Kings are called ſometimes <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> not onely in divine, but in prophane writers. The Senators of <hi>Rome,</hi> and chiefe Governours were called fathers of their countries. The common names of the Kings of the Philiſtims was <hi>Abimelech, My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King:</hi> And <hi>David</hi> ſaith to his Subjects, <hi>Come my Children, hearken.</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> uſeth that phraſe, <hi>my ſonne.</hi> It is the ſpeech of <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew, that it is fit for him that rules to carry himſelfe as a father to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Children. Now you that God hath bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo farre as to be fathers, you know what the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a father is, what bowells he hath, what care he ſhewes, what ſenſe of ſorrow, for the leaſt infirmitie of his child.</p>
            <pb n="160" facs="tcp:158707:88"/>
            <p>Again, ſecondly, Princes are called Shepheards: not onely in <hi>Homer Agamemnon</hi> is called the paſtor of the people: but <hi>Cyrus my Shepheard, Eſay</hi> 45. <hi>And God led his people as ſheepe by the hands of Moſes and Aaron, Pſal.</hi> 78. <hi>ult. And he took David from the Sheep to feed his people.</hi> Now we know in the Shepheards vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is both dilligence and love. The Shepherd conſidereth the ſtate of his flock; if there be any more infirme then others, hee is touched preſently with compaſſion towards them, he binds them up, and he doth well. So it ſhould be with thoſe in authority, they ſhould ever be reſpective of that flock that is committed to them, and deale gently, and fairely by them: for <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> if he drive on furiouſly, will loſe 10. parts at one time.</p>
            <p>Againe, thirdly, a governour is ſaid to be a head: now what reſpect there is in a head towards the members, every meere naturall man knowes.</p>
            <p>Againe, a governour is ſaid to be the husband, and the Common-wealth his wife: what reſpect a true husband carries to his true yoake-fellow, it is eaſily diſcerned; now willing he is to keepe her from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and to be the vaile of her eyes, as it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And you ſee in good <hi>Jacob</hi> when danger was towards, he put his wives in the reare, that all others might ſuffer before them. And <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith that a governour is <hi>anima,</hi> the Prince is the ſoule of the Common-wealth, and the Common-wealth is his body. Now as the ſoule is carefull for the body, ſo the Prince that is pious is carefull of thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to him. As the Eagle is the King of all Birds, ſo it is uſuall to reſemble Princes by that bird. And one
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:158707:88"/>property of that bird <hi>Moſes</hi> tels us in <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. ſhee carries her young upon her wings: and marke the care of that bird, ſaith <hi>Lipomen,</hi> for ſhee will be ſure if there be any danger from below, that her body ſhall be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her young, and the danger ſhee will be firſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of it.</p>
            <p>Now if you require inſtances of this care, and good of the people, you have it in <hi>David:</hi> when the Angel forraged among the people; <hi>O what have theſe ſheep done?</hi> he interpoſeth himſelfe, and deſireth that the hand of God might turne upon him, and his fathers houſe, that the people might be ſpared. And <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. God ſaith, if he will not ſtop him in his wrath, he will make him a mighty Nation. But <hi>Moſes</hi> though the people could be merry without him, hee would not be happie without them: the truth is, if God would not be mercifull to them, he would bee blotted out of the book of life.</p>
            <p>I need not after theſe honourable examples add the heathen; of <hi>Codrus</hi> that threw himſelf into the Armie; and <hi>Curtius</hi> that caſt himſelf into the gulfe of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Adrianus,</hi> called <hi>Titus,</hi> by name, the delight of mankind, in regard of his gracious comportment. Or tell you of the 12 Tables for the good of the people. All in authority ſhould be carefull of thoſe that are under them, ſhould be ſenſible of their grievances, that every diſturbance to them ſhould reflect upon themſelves.</p>
            <p>Abominable is that ſpirit that is in ſome men. It is ſaid of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> When I am dead let the world be mingled with fire. And <hi>Nero</hi> that would correct it, turned it much worſe, Nay while I live let it be ſo.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:158707:89"/>So that Speech of <hi>Caligula,</hi> Let them hate me, ſo they feare me. He complained ſometime in his time that he was not made famous by ſome calamity; and wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that all <hi>Rome</hi> had but one neck that he might cut it off. And <hi>Vitellius</hi> poſie: It is was a good ſmel from the Carkaſſe of a ſouldier that was killed, but better from a Citizen. Theſe words befit not the mouth of a Prince, no, not of a man: they doe not reliſh of that clemencie that is the chiefe ſtone in the Crowne of a Prince; but of that brutiſhneſſe that theſe men were guilty of. And God met with them in their kind: for there was none of them did die a dry death.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If a Prince muſt be ſolicitous of the good of his people, ſo muſt they be for him. <hi>From me and my people,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> ſo the people muſt ſay, for my King and me. If the Common-wealth be a wife, ſhee muſt be obedient, if they be children, they muſt be du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull. If it be a body, it muſt be pliable to the ſoule. If they be members, they muſt be guided by the head. If they be ſheep, they muſt ſubmit to the government of the Shepherd. That as <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Emperour ſaith, there may be a ſweet harmonie between Prince and people, that no ſtring may be too high or too low; that is the beſt muſique in the eares of God. If <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> deſire for his people, how ſhould they beg of God in the behalfe of their Soverain? <hi>Paul</hi> when he wiſheth that Prayers. ſhould be made for <hi>all men,</hi> in the firſt place he puts Kings. And it was the practiſe of holy people of God in former time. <hi>Cyprian</hi> when they were charged with ſome rebellion, We are far from that, we wiſh well to the King, ſaith he: And his Maſter before him, for ſo he calls <hi>Tertullian,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:158707:89"/>concerning the Chriſtians, that they begged of God in the behalfe of the Emperour, they deſired long life, a ſecure regiment, and reigne, a ſafe houſe, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Counſellors, ſtrong and valiant Souldiers, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Let not this be forgotten by us, we are too defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in this: many of us pray in private for our ſelves, but when doe we remember our Governours? O the light of our eyes, and the breath of ournoſtrills, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of our prayers. If it be a ſin to forget a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall father, certainly it is no leſſe to forget our politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call father.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be obſerved (which is the ſecond generall) is the promiſe that he makes.</p>
            <q>I will let the people goe.</q>
            <p>I will but touch one thing and ſo conclude, you ſee here that now he cannot get from under the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what evapourates from him: he will let the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple goe that they may ſacrifice. If god reſerve us, God willing we ſhall obſerve that he did flie off from this. But in the meane time, ſomewhat he ſaith, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; and
<q>It is no ſtrange thing, that the worſt of men have good motions ſometimes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaith another time, <hi>I have ſinned.</hi> And the ſorcerers ſay after, It is the finger of God. And <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let me die the death of the righteous, Num.</hi> 23. And <hi>Saul</hi> may ſay <hi>he hath ſinned,</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> may humble himſelfe, and <hi>Felix</hi> may ſometimes tremble, and <hi>Agrippa</hi> will cry out, he is almoſt made a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian by <hi>Paul.</hi> And it was never known, of the moſt deſperate adulterers, the moſt bloudy men, or oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, or exceſſive perſons, but ſome time or other they
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:158707:90"/>did thinke ill of their own courſes, and did think that another way was better, and it may be have had moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and reſolutions tending to reformation.</p>
            <p>The ground is, the light that God puts into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and the power that he hath indued it with, that will ſometimes put a man in minde of his abberations from the right way, that this is not the courſe hee ſhould take.</p>
            <p>Again, there is a generall illumination in the world, that enlightens every man, by this they come to have ſome notions. But as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith in another caſe, they come in frequently, and paſſe away as ſpeedily. They are like the morning dew, or the morning cloud, ſoon diſſipated, not ſo good as <hi>Ephraims</hi> cake that was halfe baked, they are ſoon gone, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith of the flower it is a thing to look on, and breath on, and ſmell to, and it is gone. So it is with theſe motions of the wicked, they paſſe away as ſmoke.</p>
            <p>Therefore, for the uſe of it; Let us not be confident of the motions, and flaſhes of the wicked, unleſſe they perſiſt and continue in them there is little hope.</p>
            <p>Nay, let us not pleaſe our ſelves for motions that are like flaſhings of lightning in the ſoule, they are not worth the talking of. When motions come that are good, cheriſh them, keep them on foot, that they may be actuated and perfected. Thus God would have us to doe, it is a ſparke of the divine fire, therefore the Lord would have it blown till it come to a flame. If at any time we finde it dying, (as like enough the dear Saints of God may doe) we muſt ſtir it up, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the grace of God by the uſe of the Ordinances of God, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. And likewife by reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:158707:90"/>upon our many omiſſions and neglects (and it may be ſuppreſſion of motions by the conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap>tion of the fearfull account we muſt give one day for theſe neglects, ſtir it up, and keep it freſh, and by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God there may come great matters. That that is now a ſparke may be a flame, that that is like a cloud no bigger then a hand, it may after mask the whole heavens. That that is now as a grain of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard ſeed, it may be a great tree, wherein the fowles of the air may make their neſts.</p>
            <p>Of all take heed of quenching and ſuppreſſing this Spirit, of puting it out, and that is done by wilfull, groſſe ſins. When God gives good motions, if men would cheriſh them and keep them alive, there might be much good in them: but when they run into foul ſins that waſte conſcience, the graces of God die, and all good motions are as far to ſeek as if they never had been. This will add to a mans judgment, when God ſhall put theſe things in his heart, and he by untimely froſts nipps them in the bud, whereas if he would che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh them, they would come to great perfection and improvement.</p>

<q>The neceſsitie of afflictions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>All faire meanes would do no good with this man; God was faine to take the rod in his hand, and then wee ſee the iſſue: ſo great is the neceſſitie of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And it drives at divers things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, afflictions make a man ſee his ſinnes, as wee ſee in the brethren of <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 41.21. In their trouble in <hi>Egypt</hi> they reflect upon their unnaturalneſſe to their brother: they confeſſe that the cauſe of this trouble and diſtreſſe was, becauſe they did not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to him, when he cried in the anguiſh of his ſoule. You may gather ſo much from the ſpeech of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> when her child was dead, ſhe comes to <hi>Eliah,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>Art thou come to call my ſinnes to remembrance and to kill my child?</hi> Affliction is that that will call a mans ſinnes to remembrance. And out of all doubt, next to the Law of God, there is no glaſſe wherein a mans ſinnes are more impartially repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him then the glaſſe of afflictions: Therefore
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:158707:92"/>
               <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>Job</hi> 36.8. When the Lord hath a man in the cords of affliction, hee ſhewes him his ſinnes, and tranſreſſions, then he can talke with him, and tell him from point to point what he hath done, and ſet his ſinnes in order before him.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that the ancients compare afflictions to the ſmiting of the Flint that fetcheth out a ſparke of fire that gives the good man light. They compare them to the wood that <hi>Eliſha</hi> caſt into the water, by which hee raiſed the head of the hatchet that was ſunke. Thoſe ſinnes that are ſunke to the bottome, that lie buried in the mud, and there is no notice ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of them, afflictions will raiſe them up, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them. They have compared it likewiſe to the clay and ſpittle that Chriſt anointed the eyes of the blind man with that hee reſtored to ſight, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. This is that that <hi>Gregory</hi> hath <hi>oculis culpa, &amp;c.</hi> that eye that was ſhut with ſinne, is opened by puniſhment; and hee hath it from <hi>David,</hi> Afflictions give underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p>The trouble that was upon the hoaſt of God ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them to ſcrutiny <hi>Achan</hi> that was the cauſe of that diſcomfiture. And the tempeſt that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners were in, cauſed them to find out <hi>Jonah</hi> that was the author of the tempeſt, of whom the ſhip muſt be diſcharged.</p>
            <p>Secondly, afflictions, as they are neceſſary to bring us to the ſight of ſinne, ſo to humiliation for it; and the wicked of the world, if the hand of God bee on them will confeſſe their ſinnes. So you ſee in <hi>Saul,</hi> ſo in <hi>Achab,</hi> ſo in <hi>Judas,</hi> when terrour of ſoule was on him, hee cries out, <hi>I have ſinned in betraying innocent
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:158707:92"/>blood.</hi> The ſpirit of a man will be tooke downe by afflictions, be hee never ſo great; for in the time of proſperitie we are apt to be proud,
<list>
                  <item>In regard of God,</item>
                  <item>In regard of Our brethren,</item>
                  <item>In regard of The things in our ſelves.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Wee are apt to be proud in regard of God, as wee ſee in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. <hi>God is not in a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mans thoughts,</hi> men thinke not of God in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> thought not of heaven: but when the Lords hand was upon him, hee ſaw whom he had provoked, and how vaine it was to lift up himſelf againſt God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a man in time of proſperitie is apt to bee proud in regard of his brethren: <hi>David</hi> while he was in proſperitie, he greatly cared not for that wrong that hee did to his ſervant faithfull <hi>Uriah:</hi> but when the hand of God was upon him, hee was afraid to doe the leaſt harme to his mortall enemy, as appears in that inſtance betweene him and <hi>Saul</hi> in the Cave. And he would not ſuffer the railing dog <hi>Shimei</hi> to bee puniſhed when he came barking fearfully, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.11. affliction upon him, mortified his ſpirit, and killed his pride.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when wee are in proſperitie we are proud of thoſe things that are in us: people ſometimes are proud of beautie, ſometimes of ſtrength, ſometimes of apparell, ſometimes of wealth: Now all theſe things are layd low; therefore it is very neceſſary, the woman that was proud of her beautie, if the hand of God ſeize on her by a ſharpe acute feaver, when her feather is brought to a Kercheife, there is no
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:158707:93"/>more talke of the pride of her beautie, that is taken off. So, the ſtrong man that bragged of his ſtrength, when a feaver hath grappled with him, and laid him all along, and tooke him off from his feet, then hee acknowledgeth the vanitie of this houſe of clay: this body of humiliation, as the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. So for apparell, when Gods hand is upon peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they more deſire an eaſie pillow then gay cloths. And for wealth, it doth but little comfort in a ſharp ſickneſſe; a man would give all for one nights reſt, for one dayes eaſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, (beloved) affliction is neceſſary to work a man to good reſolutions and purpoſes: So <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> being in affliction and trouble, hee will have none acknowledged but the God of heaven. So likewiſe the prodigall ſonne being in trouble, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to goe to his father, and ſay, <hi>Father I have ſinned againſt thee.</hi> To go no further, when the hand of God was upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his people, hee cries out, <hi>I will let the people goe.</hi> And I will bee ſo charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that for the preſent hee might ſpeake uprightly.</p>
            <p>For the uſe of this; It ſhould teach us: Firſt, to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie God, when hee inflicts judgements; for how ſhould God make good his juſtice to the world, if he ſhould not puniſh ſometimes, if offenders ſhould goe alwayes free? How ſhould God make good his power to the world, if hee ſhould not ſhew himſelfe able to ſubdue the contumacious? how ſhould hee make good his wiſedome to the world, if having uſed many faire invitations, and plauſible meanes, and thoſe contemned, hee ſhould not draw out the ſword againſt rebellious ones? <hi>Solomon</hi> makes it a part of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:158707:93"/>wiſedome to uſe ſeverity in the right place.</p>
            <p>Secondly, wee ſhould juſtifie God in inflicting of judgements, becauſe they are ſo neceſſary for us: for wee have proud hearts of our owne, and God knows they are not eaſily ſubdued; before they bee brought downe, the fleſh muſt ſmart to ſome purpoſe. And this ſmoake is not onely found dwelling in the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but in the habitations of the righteous. Looke on <hi>Hezekiah:</hi> after God had added a leaſe to his life of 15. yeares more, the Text ſaith, <hi>his heart was lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. And this ſinne of pride is ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to us, that when all other ſinnes decreaſe, this is improved. Nay the Devill will watch us ſuch a turne to continue the ſinne of pride, that rather then wee ſhall not bee proud, hee will make us proud becauſe wee are humble. Therefore the Lord laies his hand on us, by ſpirituall, and temporall, and corporall viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that hee may bring us to be humble.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you obſerve that place, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.7. the Lord ſaith there, that he will <hi>melt,</hi> and <hi>trie</hi> the people for ſaith he, <hi>what elſe ſhould I doe to the daughter of my people?</hi> As if he had ſaid, I know no better way to cure them then to put them into the melting pot of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, there I muſt purge them from their droſſe; certainly they muſt have ſome ſharpe medicine for the purging out of the malignant humour.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſince afflictions are ſo neceſſary, labour in the feare of God that they may be profitable. And then afflictions are profitable, when they bring us to a ſight of our ſinnes. There is never an affliction that God ſends upon a man, but it ſaith to him as <hi>Ehud</hi> ſaid to <hi>Eglon, I have a meſſage to thee from God.</hi> In
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:158707:94"/>
               <hi>Micah</hi> 6. wee are bid to <hi>heare the rod.</hi> O that men could hearken to it, it would teach them many good leſſons. It would take them from the love of the world, and teach them to repoſe the confidence in God. It would teach them to ſearch and try their waies, to find out the <hi>Achan</hi> that troubleth the hoſt.</p>
            <p>Againe in the ſecond place, affliction is uſefull, and profitable to men, when it makes them humble, and low, not onely to confeſſe that God is juſt, as <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> ſaith, Lord it is hard in regard of that ſtrength that I have, that povertie of abilitie that is in mee: but it is juſt in regard of my deſert. Not onely ſo, but to mourne for ſinne. Wee have put God out of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious way of clemencie, and mercy into a ſtrange path of juſtice, <hi>Eſay</hi> 28. <hi>It is Gods ſtrange worke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, then affliction is uſefull, when it makes us flie to God; when like the corne that is winnowed wee fall down at the feet of him that winnoweth, and not like the chaffe flie in his face. When wee make our peace with God, and give him no reſt till God be reconciled to us; For, for a man in affliction to doe as <hi>Abſolom,</hi> to run three yeares together from his father, it is a poore uſe of the rod that God ſends.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, then affliction is uſefull, when God works in the heart, a reſolution and purpoſe of doing better then before: as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 66.14. Hee ſpeakes of <hi>vowes</hi> that he made, and <hi>words</hi> that hee uttered with his mouth in his affliction. And you may gather from that of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> hee deſired the Prophet to tell him what ſigne he ſhould have that he ſhould <hi>goe up to the houſe of the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20. As if hee deſired his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:158707:94"/>upon no other termes but that he might ſerve the Lord better: <hi>felix neceſsitas.</hi> O bleſſed affliction that makes a man better! when a man comes to this <hi>Betheſda,</hi> and is cured of his diſeaſe, bleſſed man hee that ever the hand of God was on him: that man may ſay with <hi>David, It is good for me that I was afflicted.</hi> And God <hi>of his exceeding goodneſſe cauſed me to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled;</hi> when the Arke thus moves upward by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is well. When the fleſh ſinkes, and the ſpirit floates, it is a ſigne that theſe waters of <hi>Marah</hi> are made ſweet; though the body loſe, the ſpirit gaines: ſo I have done with that.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the entertaining of this motion by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the courſe was this.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> bids him appoint his owne time when this ſhould be done.</item>
               <item>Secondly, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> appoints it.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, <hi>Moſes</hi> entertaines it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, hee bids him appoint his time;</p>
            <p>But here in the firſt place it may be demanded, how it came to paſſe that <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſo ready to gratifie <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in his requeſt; that hee is ſo ſudden, and quick in it?</p>
            <p>There may be two reaſons given.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, in regard of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Secondly, in regard of the people.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, in regard of <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> this was a ſparke, and <hi>Moſes</hi> thought fit to nouriſh it. This reſolution was good, and there ſhall be nothing wanting in <hi>Moſes</hi> to cheriſh it. The wicked muſt bee followed, and held to it, and plyed, for it is but ſeldome that wee get them at advantage of good reſolutions. And
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:158707:95"/>when they are there, <hi>ſtant in lubrice,</hi> they ſtand in ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery places, they are in danger of recidivation, and relapſe. Therefore they muſt be plyed and followed, and fomented, that if it bee poſſible their promiſes may come to performances. Their Iron muſt bee ſtricken when it is hot, and ſoftned by the fire, ſaith <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> or elſe after a while it will come to its former hardneſſe, and be leſſe malleable. Doe you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that place, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17. when the ſervants of <hi>Benhadad</hi> came with ropes about their necks? they watch for every word that falls from the King to catch it. Therefore hee had no ſooner ſaid <hi>my brother Benhadad,</hi> but they clap in <hi>thy brother Benhadad.</hi> So wee muſt with thoſe that are comming to good, get ground on them, to bring them to performances. As <hi>Ezra</hi> when he had brought the people to mourne for their ſinnes, hee leaves not till they had entred into covenant with God. This is the reaſon in regard of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond reaſon is in regard of the people. That is given by <hi>Toſtatus;</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſo quicke in anſwering <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> becauſe he conceived that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would be ready to let the people go: and this he rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in. Now thinks he, my labour will be profitable for thoſe people that I love ſo well, and whoſe wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare I tender: ſo now I ſhall ſee an end of my tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous imployment: now the people of God ſhall bee beholding to me, to be their leader out of captivitie. Thus the good man rejoyced when there was but the leaſt hope of the ſucceſſe of his labours.</p>
            <p>So all Gods meſſengers are affected, when they ſee their indeavours proſper, how doe they rejoyce?
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:158707:95"/>Much paynes had this good <hi>Moſes</hi> indured for love to the people, &amp; many injuries had he ſwallowed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, and all out of a deſire to doe them good, that they might thrive under him. Nay, hee pawned his ſalvation one time for them, that if God would not bee mercifull to them, hee would blot him out. If they thrive, he rejoyceth, if otherwiſe hee mournes, and laments, and betakes himſelfe to God for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe.</p>
            <p>It is the caſe of all Gods meſſengers that are well affected: doe you thinke it was not a griefe of ſoule to <hi>Eſay, Eſay</hi> 49 to ſay, <hi>I have ſpent my, ſtrength in vaine?</hi> hee complaines that he had laboured in vaine. Was it not a griefe of ſoule to <hi>Jeremiah</hi> when hee found ſuch ill ſucceſſe of his labours that hee reſolved to ſpeake no more <hi>in the name of the Lord? Jer.</hi> 20. And can any wonder that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſhould goe in the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his ſoule upon his imployment, when God tells him before, that hee ſhould meet with a contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melious people? The very feare of being unſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full made <hi>Jonah</hi> runne to <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> and wave the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, and ſubterfuge the imployment.</p>
            <p>Therefore on the other ſide thinke what a joy it is to thoſe that ſee their labours thrive. The gardiner hath not ſo muſt joy in his plants, and the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in his crop, or the indulgent father to ſee the welfare of his child, as the husbandman of God hath to ſee his people thrive in grace. I would this were taken to heart. Shall I ſpeake freely to you? It is not your civill courteſies, it is not your countenance, nor your liberalitie; if all your gaines ſhould flow into our purſes, it would not ſo much rejoyce our ſoules,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:158707:96"/>as to find you profit that our worke may proſper, that wee may fit ſome building for the Temple. For when you thrive, wee advance Gods glory, that is, or ſhould be the end of all our doings; wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the ſeale of our miniſtery. Thirdly, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of doing the greateſt good in the world, of converting of ſoules. Laſtly, we procure to our ſelves the hope of eternall glory: for <hi>thoſe that turne others ſhall ſhine.</hi> Therefore give us leave to ſay as <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>We have no greater joy then to ſee our Children walke in the truth;</hi> And to ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Yee are our crowne, and our glory, and our joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore in the name of God, even for his ſake, and for your owne ſoules ſake, and for the comfort of thoſe that are imployed among you, and that take paines in the word and doctrine, doe not make the hearts of Gods meſſengers ſad. Give them not cauſe with <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to deſire to lodg in a garden of Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbers, to wiſh that they had never ſeene your faces, becauſe of your improfitableneſſe. But commend their labours to God by your fruitfulneſſe; and carry your ſelves ſo, that they may give account with joy, and not with ſorrow: ſo much for that. Now for the words;
<q>Glory over me, when ſhall I pray.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The words in the originall <hi>Behoth pergnali,</hi> glorifie thy ſelfe upon me; expoſitors are very various in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the meaning of theſe words.</p>
            <q>Glory over me.</q>
            <p>Shall wee take it in this ſenſe, as if it were an ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or a kind of exclamation of this man? O the glory that God hath put upon me! here is glory
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:158707:96"/>upon mee indeed, that this great King, this proud Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, ſhould ſue to me, and intreat! hee that poured contempt upon mee before, and for my ſake vexed the people of God the more, that now hee ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, O what an honour and glory is over me!</p>
            <p>Surely (beloved) <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of a <hi>ſpirit of glory reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Gods Children,</hi> and it ſhines in this, that the very wicked ſometimes petition to the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Remember the inſtances I gave the laſt day. What an honour was it to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> to bee ſought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> that hated him before? What an honour was it to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that all his brethrens ſheafes ſhould bow to his, according to the preſage of his dreame, and that he muſt nouriſh them that maliced him? What an honour was it to <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>Saul</hi> ſhould deſire his favour when he had him in the cave, and gave a pregnant inſtance of his loyaltie? What an honour was it to the Prophet, that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſhould ſue to him to reſtore his arme? And to <hi>Job,</hi> that his friends that were ſo deeply uncharitable in cenſuring him, muſt be beholding to him for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion? Surely whenſoever Gods people take knowledg in it, they are bound to magnifie God for this great favour. But the words will not indure this ſenſe: for both the Conjugation, and the Mood wherein they are uſed, will not admit it. Therefore wee muſt ſeeke another ſenſe. <hi>Glory over me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reverend <hi>Calvin</hi> takes them by way of Antitheſis in this manner, as if he ſhould ſay, Thou haſt little reaſon to glory in the Magitians, they abuſe thee with ſhowes, but now it comes to the removall of the plague, they cannot helpe thee; I make no queſtion,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:158707:97"/>but thou haſt found how waine they are, <hi>Glory over me,</hi> that is, in my help for I am able, if thou wilt heare the motion that I make I will remove this from thee.</p>
            <q>The Wicked are no ſecuritie to a man, the godly muſt help.</q>
            <p>Well may they be fuell to the fire, but never able to quench the flame. Hee were a mad man that to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure himſelfe from the Fire, would pile a many Billets betweene him and the flame; ſuch are the wicked. No; in the day of trouble and vexation, one <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſtand in the gap is worth a thouſand of others. Ten men in <hi>Sodome</hi> would have ſaved thoſe Cities from that conflagration: Nay <hi>Lot</hi> bayled them, all the time hee was in it; One man ſhould ſave a Citie; One <hi>Micaiah</hi> is worth foure hundred falſe prophets.</p>
            <p>There is a third ſenſe that is commonly hearkned unto, and I liſten to it; <hi>Glory over me.</hi> That is, take thou the glory of appointing the time when I ſhall pray: Though it be true that I that thou ſueſt to, to remove the plague, ſhould have my owne time, yet take thou the glory to appoint the time, and I will doe it. That I take to be the full ſenſe and meaning of the phraſe.</p>
            <p>Now it will be demanded, why <hi>Moſes</hi> did grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>Pharaoh</hi> thus farre, that he ſhould appoint the time when the judgement of God ſhould be removed, why he was ſo favourable in this particular? divers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be given of it, and each of them will yeeld an obſervation.</p>
            <p>Firſt <hi>Moſes</hi> well weighed that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> might have a conceite, (having heard that <hi>Moſes</hi> was learned in all the learning of the Egyptians) that he might work
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:158707:97"/>by conſtellations, and other Aſtrologicall practiſes: hee might take advantage of the poſition, and aſpects of the planets and preſently doe it, and ſo gull <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> with naturall cauſes, and make him beleeve it was a ſupernaturall miracle. Becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> conceived this might be in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> imagination, hee gives him leave to preſcribe his owne time.</p>
            <q>This hath ever been the care of Gods people, and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for the greater glory of God, ever to doe their works after that manner that they might bee free from exception.</q>
            <p>That it might not be imputed to naturall cauſes; but that the vertue, and power of God ſupernaturally might ever be acknowledged. Marke it in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. When <hi>Eliah</hi> was to confound the Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> hee cauſed the ſacrifice to bee put upon the Altar, hee cauſed the wood to be layed, and when he had done, he cauſed foure barrells of water to be caſt upon the wood and the ſacrifice, the firſt, ſecond, and third time; and when he had done hee cauſed a great trench or ditch about to bee filled with water. All theſe things ſerved to make it improbable that ever fire ſhould come to conſume it, unleſſe it were brought by the hand of man: hee did it on purpoſe, that they might ſee the worke of God, and ſo they acknowledged when the fire came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the wood, and the ſacrifice, and to lick up all the water in the trench; in ſo much that the people being abſolutely ſatisfied cried out, <hi>The Lord he is God, the Lord he is God.</hi> The like we ſee in the proceeding of <hi>Eliſha</hi> with <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Aſsyrian,</hi> when <hi>Naaman</hi> came to be cured of his Leproſie; Hee did not ſpeak
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:158707:98"/>with him; hee did not come out, and lay his hand on the ſore, as <hi>Naaman</hi> expected; why? This might have leſſened the glory of the <hi>Miracle;</hi> hee would have imputed it to connaturall cauſes; to ſome vertue or skill in him; but when he ſends him word, Go and waſh in ſuch a place, and never ſaw him nor ſpake to him, he muſt needs acknowledg it to be a miracle.</p>
            <p>The like wee ſee in the works of Chriſt in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, how he freed them from all exception, and juſt queſtion in the world. When he was to turne the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into wine at the marriage, he did it not preſently, he ſtayed till all the wine was ſpent, and there was generall notice almoſt taken of the defect of it, then he cauſeth the water pots to be filled with water, and bids the men draw and carry to the governour; all theſe ſeemed to ſet back the worke, but they ſet it forward, for it cauſed all men to magnifie it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it to be the immediate power of God. So he dealt with the man at <hi>Betheſda;</hi> all the people took notice of him, he was a man that had been 38. years together, and would faine have been put into the poole, but he had never a friend to help him, you ſee what Chriſt did, he did but onely ſpeak to him, and ſo many of them acknowledged the wonderfull pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God. So that man that was cured of his blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>John</hi> 9. our bleſſed Saviour was pleaſed to pitch upon a perſon, that all the world took notice of, and none could cure him, he was borne blind. So the man at the Beautifull gate <hi>Act.</hi> 3. there was a work wrought on him that was free from all exception, therefore the Elders, and the high Prieſts, they confeſſed that not onely it was a great work, but a
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:158707:98"/>miracle, a great miracle, and there was no exception againſt it. Thus Gods people in all times labour to do their works that may be free from all exception, and prejudice.</p>
            <p>I would to God it might be ſo with us that in all the works that we do, we might be free from all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalitie, and ſelf-reſpects. For the devillalies in the wind, and puts into the hearts of thoſe that are his own, to take exception at any thing that is done well in the world. If they do good works, it is out of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie (will he ſay,) or vain glory, or reſpect to a mans owne profit. Thus they ſlander godly peoples practiſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us have a care to doe our works ſo, as they may be free from all juſt exception. Let us bee carefull to doe them in integritie of heart, to approve our hearts to God Almighty, and that will beare us out againſt all mens exceptions. Art thou to doe a worke of charity, and the devill will ſlander thee for vain glory? ſhun the applauſe of the world, ſpite the devill in that. Againe, doth the devill ſay, thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt charitie a matter of profit from men? Make them the objects of thy charity that are notable to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence thee, (as Chriſt ſaith) that the world may ſay, it is not a benefit put out to intereſt, but make it a work of mercy.</p>
            <p>Againe, doth the devill ſlander thee, that in the works of God thou doeſt them that God may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper thee in <hi>thy basket, and in thy ſtore?</hi> Make the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill a lier, ſerve God in adverſitie as well as in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. So <hi>Job,</hi> the devill ſlandered him ſo, <hi>doth Job ſerve God for nought?</hi> Therefore let us do as that holy
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:158707:99"/>man did, when God frowned on him, he ſerved him, and was patient under that hand of God that lay on him; So much of the firſt reaſon.</p>
            <p>A ſecond is this; <hi>Moſes</hi> might thinke that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> might hold it for an advantage to preſcribe the time. He might think, ſurely I ſhall now diſtreſſe <hi>Moſes,</hi> and put him by that he thinks of; he thinks he ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently go upon it; no, I will do what I can to hinder his thoughts and purpoſe; he ſhall doe it in my time. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> might thinke this an advantage to himſelf: <hi>Moſes</hi> is willing to yeeld, that he might ſee he was able to do it: And
<q>God ſometimes gives advantage to the wicked that his own glory might be the greater.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A man would thinke there was a great advantage againſt the people of God, <hi>Judg.</hi> 7. when the Army of <hi>Gedeon</hi> was defalked from 32000. to 300. and the other did lie as <hi>Graſhoppers</hi> upon the earth, yet you ſee what was the iſſue, the barley cake that tumbled down, (as the man had it in his dreame) overthrew the Tents of <hi>Midian:</hi> God was willing they ſhould have the advantage in regard of proviſion, and number, yet you ſee what became of it. Was it not a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that <hi>Saul</hi> had againſt <hi>David,</hi> when hee requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an hundred foreskins of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> for a dowry with his daughter? he thought it a great advantage, and would puzzle him exceedingly; thought hee, is it not more probable, that one <hi>David</hi> ſhould die then a 100. <hi>Philiſtines?</hi> yet you ſee for all this advantage <hi>David</hi> comes off with honour, and in ſtead of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred hee gives him two hundred.</p>
            <p>Was there not a great advantage on the part of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:158707:99"/>againſt <hi>David?</hi> I, all <hi>Iſrael</hi> thought ſo: for the very preſence of that uncircumciſed monſter did worke terrour in their hearts, and paleneſſe in their faces. Was it not a great advantage, he was tall, and as the ſonnes of <hi>Anak,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> was a little man, if it be true as he is deſcribed? What was a poore ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hook to a ſpeare that was as a Weavers beame? was it not a great advantage to have a glittering ſharpe Sword; and the other but a few ſtones out of the brook? That he ſhould be armed <hi>Cap a pe,</hi> and come againſt a naked man? all the world gave him for loſt: yet you ſee, though he had all this advantage, and he thought ſo himſelf: for he ſaith in ſcorne, <hi>Come, and I will give thy fleſh to the fowles of the ayre:</hi> for all this <hi>David</hi> layd him along, and cut off his head.</p>
            <p>The like we ſee in the Army of the <hi>Aſsyrians,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20. They thought the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by fighting on the Mountains; therefore if they did fight in the valleys they thought they ſhould be victorious: God is willing to give them the advantage; into the valleys they come, but have they better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe? Nay, though they have the advantage of the place, and of the number too: for it is ſaid the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God did lie before them as two companies of Kids, and they were an infinite company, yet wee ſee what was the iſſue.</p>
            <p>So we may ſay of that great Army that came againſt <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Wee are not able to ſtand before this company:</hi> So in the Army that <hi>Senacherib</hi> brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> rayling <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> bid them ſubmit, for all <hi>Iſraels</hi> duſt was not enough for every man a handfull; yet for all they had that advantage the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:158707:100"/>Lord overthrew them by a few. So God did give the Devill advantage againſt <hi>Job,</hi> as much as he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: he did but deſire to touch him; he gives him leave to touch his goods, his children, his body, that he made him the moſt fearfull ſpectacle that ever the ſunne beheld: yet when all this was done, for all that <hi>Job</hi> was proved, and the devill was confounded.</p>
            <p>And our bleſſed Lord himſelf gave great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the devill for his greater glory. He ſuffered him to tempt him in the Wilderneſſe, that wild place, where there was nothing but beaſts; the place was enough to have filled his heart with horrour; and to tempt him after forty dayes faſt, and when he was an hungry; and to tempt him with that that might ſooneſt move a hungry ſtomach, with proviſion of bread: all theſe advantages God gratified the devill with, that his glory might be the greater, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the devill more.</p>
            <p>So afterward, he ſuffered himſelfe to be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and nayled to the croſſe, (and then they thought they had advantage enough) nay to give up the ghoſt, and to die and to grapple with death in his owne tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; yet his glory was greater by giving the devill that great advantage.</p>
            <p>It was a great advantage the Philoſopher had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that poore man in the Counſell of <hi>Nice;</hi> the cunning Sophiſter came upon him with many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The other man in the plainneſſe of his ſpirit ſo anſwered him, for all his advantage in learning the poore man bunged up his mouth, and converted him to the Chriſtian faith. What an advantage had the Pope againſt <hi>Luther</hi> when he roſe up? What an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:158707:100"/>combate was between them! The one a poore, Monk, and againſt him all of the Church, of <hi>Rome: Lather</hi> had temporall, and ſpirituall authoritie, all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him to bury him under, yet the worke of God was made more glorious by this, and he lighted a candleithat by Gods bleſſing ſhall never be put out.</p>
            <p>Well, for the uſe of this. Let us not bee too much dejected when God gives ſome advantage to the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though they have advantage, of number, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion. There is not the greateſt man in the world but God hath a hooke for his noſtrills. It may bee God gives them theſe advantages for their greater ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines: he racks them high that they may fall into the greater miſchiefe. God is able to ſend an Angell that in one night ſhall kill ſo many in the Hoſt of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib:</hi> God is able to ſend a Panick feare among the <hi>Aſsyrians</hi> that ſhall make them run away as if they were mad men, and leave their furniſhed tents to their enemies. God is able to make the <hi>Midianites</hi> turne their of words into each others ſides, God is able by looking our of the pillar to confound the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in that manner, that there ſhall not be one man left to earry the newes of the oyer throw.</p>
            <p>And give me lewe to tell you, we of the proteſtant faith have occaſion to glorifie God: God of late hath abated the pride, and pulled down the inſolencie and preſumption, &amp; met with the mighty in their deviſes, and left thoſe to loſſe that were proud of their owne number and proviſion, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord for his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. It is the Lords doing, and it ought to be mervai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous in our eyes:</hi> and that heart that is not affected with it, I dare ſay it, hath not the power of Religion in it.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:158707:101"/>And that is the ſecond Reaſon.</p>
            <p>A third reaſon may bee this, <hi>Moſes</hi> gives leave to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to pitch his time, Why? It may be <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would have held it ſome diſparagement, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, if he ſhould not have conſtituted his own time; therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not ſtand with him in this, but gratifies him; he could as eaſily do it in his time, as if he himſelf had appointed it. Though he were a man of great command, he will not vie with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> now, but if he thinke it an honour to appoint the time he ſhall. Indeed the children of God, ſo God may bee glorified, they do not greatly ſtand upon prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. He will not vie with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> now for matter of appointing a day.</p>
            <q>Gods Children, ſo God may be glorified ſtand not upon termes of dignitie or preheminence.</q>
            <p>The Lord ſaith to <hi>Cain</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Abel,</hi> if it be preheminence that thou lookeſt for, <hi>his deſire ſhall bee ſubject to thee, he ſhall not ſtand with thee for it. Aaron,</hi> though he were the elder, he doth not ſtand upon it, but is willing that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould have the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. And <hi>David,</hi> though he were anoynted King in reverſion after <hi>Saul,</hi> yet he uſed <hi>Saul</hi> with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, he would not invade any of his honours, he would not envie him the glory that God had put upon him: he would ſtay the time, and tarry the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie that God was pleaſed to accommodate for his advancement, and when he was moved with the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the daughter of <hi>Saul</hi> in marriage, he was not greatly moved with that. So our bleſſed Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did not ſtand upon titles of the world; when he might have beene made a King, he would not, he fled
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:158707:101"/>away. Why? The Fathers give divers reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith that ſame humour of the people for the making him a King, it grew from their glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony; they thought he was a fit man to be their King that could fit their Epicurious palate: he goes away rather. Saith the ſame Father, he would give us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to deſpiſe the dignities of the world and the honours of the ſame. So <hi>Gregory</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, he fled to give us an example of contemning the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the world. <hi>Cyrill</hi> ſaith, he did go away, becauſe he would ſhew that his <hi>Kingdome was not of this world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his 25. tract upon <hi>John,</hi> hits upon this reaſon, he would not be made a King, that hee might give no way to any ſedition, or rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Romans;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, I live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der authority, I content my ſelfe to be as I am, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not to invade the priviledges of Princes; in the name of God let them enjoy them, you ſhall not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe me to their power, to contradict their greatneſſe; I will not do it. So hee alwayes carried himſelf as one that cared not for the dignities of the world, and was willing to leave them to thoſe they belonged to. So he counſelled his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>The Rulers of the Gentiles rule over you:</hi> leave thoſe authorities to them, it is not fit for you to exerciſe them. And <hi>Paul</hi> was not much moved with the great breadth, and traine that the falſe Apoſtles carried, though they exalted themſelves by great titles. He grieved for the diſperſing of their leaven, but for himſelf he was content to be accounted as nothing, ſo God might be glorified.</p>
            <p>For the uſe of it. It ſhould teach us all as <hi>Moſes</hi> here to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:158707:102"/>be indifferent in matters of honour and preheminence, ſo we may alway preſerve Gods glory that that be not impeached, leave them to thoſe that deſire them, and hunt after them, as <hi>Haman</hi> that could indure none at the banquet but himſelf. As <hi>Pompey,</hi> and <hi>Ceſar,</hi> the one would not indure an equall, the other not a ſuperiou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. As the <hi>Phariſees</hi> that did <hi>all to bee ſeene of men;</hi>

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ery creatures of vaine glory. And <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> a man that <hi>loved preheminence,</hi> 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. <hi>Let us in the feare of God approve our ſelves to God, to have our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences upright to him.</hi> And if once we know Gods favour towards us, we will ſlight all the dignities of the world, and leave them to thoſe Camelions that live by that ayre. And to come to the point intended, they are not commended that men commend, but that God commendeth: One word of approbation from him is worth a thouſand Encomiums, and large pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyricks of men: Surely, <hi>God will honour thoſe that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him. And ſuch honour have all his Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>When ſhall I pray for thee?</q>
            <p>Some out of this clauſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> obſerve theſe three things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> fitneſſe to pray, if he will have it done preſently, hee is content to doe it inſtantly if hee will.</item>
               <item>Secondly, <hi>Moſes</hi> confidence in prayer; any time when he will, he makes no doubt but God will heare him.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, <hi>Moſes</hi> charity, <hi>when ſhall I pray for thee? and thy people, and thy ſervants?</hi> Though hee were an enemy to him, and uſed him diſcourteouſly, yet hee would pray for him.</item>
            </list>
            <pb n="191" facs="tcp:158707:102"/>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>when ſhall I pray?</hi> as if he were ready to pray alway.</p>
            <q>Godly people are alway in a good diſpoſition for prayer.</q>
            <p>They keep in themſelves a readineſſe for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of that dutie. We have a rule in divinitie, that affirmative precepts bind <hi>ſemper,</hi> but not <hi>ad ſemper,</hi> that is, a man is not tied to the continuall performance of them, to doe nothing elſe. A man is not tied all day to pray, and continually to give almes, or to heare the word of God. But he is bound <hi>ſemper,</hi> that is, to have alway a readineſſe of diſpoſition to holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: ſo here it was in <hi>Moſes.</hi> It is fitly ſaid by our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, <hi>pray alway,</hi> and by the Apoſtle, <hi>pray conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.17. There were thoſe that groſſely underſtood this: for they thought the ſtrength of that counſell and admonition was, that a man ſhould wave preaching, and receiving of the Sacrament, and all parts of Gods worſhip, meerely for that dutie of prayer. Nay, they thought a man ſhould intermit the works of his ordinary calling and vocation, meerely to be given to prayer: Therefore thoſe Euchites, thoſe men that pervert this place, of whom <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſpeake, they imployed all the time they could gaine from their ſleepe, and meate, to pray.</p>
            <p>It would but ſquander away the time, and ravell it out unprofitably to beſtow a large confutation of theſe people. For certainly, God never intended that one of his ordinances ſhould juſtle out another. There muſt be a time for hearing, and for praying, and for working in a mans calling. That Apoſtle that ſaith, <hi>pray continually,</hi> ſaith, be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon to preach, and heare the word, and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:158707:103"/>wiſheth them to give to the poore, and to worke in their callings. God never intended his ordinances ſhould enterfere, or exclude each other; but they muſt be ſorted out in due time and in fit opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>
            <p>But others have not well agreed about theſe words for praying continually. Some underſtand that this conſiſts in a mans good life: he that lives a holy life prayes continually. Truely as the Greek father ſaith, good works have a loud voyce in the eares of God, and that man prayes ſtill that is doing good ſtill. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſticks not to ſay that good works have the place of prayer with God, and impetrate. But I think not that that is the meaning of the Apoſtle. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we underſtand it, <hi>pray continually;</hi> that is, at ſet times, and obſerve them with a <hi>non obſtante.</hi> So <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> underſtands it.</p>
            <p>Others underſtand it, <hi>Pray continually,</hi> that is, upon all fit occaſions lift up your ſoules to God, though but in ſhort ejaculations.</p>
            <p>Others underſtand it, <hi>pray continually,</hi> that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fainting, though you have not the returne of your petitions preſently, yet pray without wearineſſe.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Auſtin</hi> lights upon another for our purpoſe, <hi>Pray continually,</hi> that is, ever be diſpoſed, and fit to pray. That wee may ſay as <hi>David, O God my heart is ready.</hi> Surely that <hi>David</hi> that could pray ſeven times a day, and that <hi>Daniel</hi> that could pray three times a day in a ſolemne manner, retiring themſelves from all occaſions to performe that dutie to God; wee may well thinke that theſe people kept themſelves in a fit diſpoſition, in a readineſſe to performe that dutie: they
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:158707:103"/>were ready upon all occaſions that God offered to turne themſelves to God.</p>
            <p>I deſire for the uſe of it that according to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of theſe people, wee would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ready. There is a great defect, and it is the worſe becauſe it is ſo neceſſary a practiſe for us. There be ſome that are ſo buried in the cares of the world, and ſo taken up with worldly occaſions, like <hi>Martha</hi> they are buſie about many things, that they have no time with <hi>Mary</hi> to intend the beſt things. They are ſo unſetled by worldly occaſions that it is a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can put themſelves into a courſe to pray: their hearts are untuned, they can hardly put them into a way of prayer, and ſupplication. And when they come to it, as that old father ſaid, their bodies are at Church, and their minds are at home. Others are ſo taken up with pleaſures and recreations, that they have no mind to pray. There are other Epicurious, filthy people that outſlip the morning prayer, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the evening ſacrifice comes, they drown their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in drinke, that they have more need of ſleep then mind to pray.</p>
            <p>There are others that put themſelves from a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and readineſſe to prayer by malice: they are ſo ſoure of that leaven that they know not how to pray. It is not fit they ſhould come to God for peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out peace. They make God bind their ſinnes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will not forgive their brethren.</p>
            <p>We ſhould ſo live, as they that looke daily to die, and if ſo, then we ſhould be alway fit to pray. It is the beſt preparation for death, O there is none like that. A ſpirit full of ſupplication, a ſoule that is ſtill
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:158707:104"/>ſending holy ejaculations to God Almighty, and that keeps it ſelfe in a fitneſſe for holy duties, that ſoule is fit to be a ſacrifice to God, that ſoule can ſay, <hi>So come Lord Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore I beſeech you in the name of God, take heed of worldlineſſe, of Epicurianiſme, of wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, of gluttony, and ſurfeiting, of malice, and all groſſe ſinnes: For theſe groſſe ſinnes that men accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome themſelves to fall into, hurt the foot of prayer, and lame it, that it cannot goe to God, keepe your ſelves from theſe: be ever carefull in holy wayes to walke in the preſence of God, and then you ſhall have encouragment to goe to the throne of grace, and that with boldneſſe, and confidence, which is the next thing in <hi>Moſes</hi> prayer, he comes to God with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but ſo much for this time.</p>

He yeelds, <hi>Bee it according to thy Word,</hi> that is, I will obſerve thine owne time. Then he gives the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he doth ſo, <hi>that thou mayſt know that there is none like the Lord.</hi> It ſhall appeare in the removall of this judgement, thou ſhalt ſee all the Frogs confined to their proper element of water. For the firſt, the yeelding.</p>
            <q>Be it according to thy word.</q>
            <pb n="196" facs="tcp:158707:105"/>
            <p>Some man may think, it would have been more fit for <hi>Moſes</hi> to expoſtulate then to yeeld to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> &amp; he might thus have ſaid, Doſt thou requeſt a courteſie at my hands, and limit me my time? ſurely if I doe the favour, I will obſerve my own ſeaſon, Beggers muſt be no chooſers: if a man give freely, all circumſtances are left in his diſcretion to his owne libertie. But to anſwer theſe people, ſurely <hi>Moſes</hi> had much diſpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelf, if having once yeelded to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the power of preſcribing the time, he ſhould have eaten his word. Firſt, it had been unworthy of <hi>Moſes</hi> to have gone back. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> might have replyed and ſaid, what inconſtancy is this? to give with one hand, and to take away with the other? thou either diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the cauſe, or art diffident of the power of thy God that thou wouldeſt feare me with.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it would have appeared a great neglect in <hi>Moſes</hi> of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he had given libertie to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to preſcribe the time. Princes are not to bee dallied with: if he ſhould have fallen off now, and not have obſerved the time when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had ſet it, certainly he had provoked <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he had done wrong to the cauſe, the uſage of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had been courſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of ſo great a Majeſtie. But to come to the obſervation, it is this.</p>
            <q>It hath ever been the manner of Gods people in all times, fairely to intreat and eaſily to deale with, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively to uſe and not to irritate others that have been of place and qualitie, though they have been ſtrangers to them, both in judgment and affections.</q>
            <p>In <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7. ſaith God to <hi>Cain,</hi> in the behalf of <hi>Abel, his deſire ſhall be to thee, and thou ſhalt rule over him.</hi>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:158707:105"/>As if he ſhould ſay, if thou think that my acceptation of his ſacrifice will puffe him up, feare not that, it ſhall not ſwell him ſo as that he ſhall forget that reſpect, that is due to thee as the elder brother, and the firſt borne. God will provide that his deſire ſhall be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his brother in all things that are lawfull, and he ſhall rule over him as the Elder. In <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.3. when <hi>Eſau</hi> met <hi>Jacob,</hi> he bowed ſeven times to the ground, and in the courſe of his ſpeech calls himſelf his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: which was not a vaine, light complement, but ſeriouſly ſpoken: yet farre was it from betraying of his birthright (as ſome have thought,) by giving that away; but he did it ſhewing reſpect to him as hee was a great Prince, for ſo was <hi>Eſau</hi> at this time. For the promiſe he knew ſhould be performed to his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie, the <hi>Idumeans</hi> ſerved <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Joaſh</hi> 120. yeares, but the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſerved not the <hi>Idumeans;</hi> he reſpected him though as a great Prince. The like we ſee in the carriage of <hi>Moſes</hi> towards <hi>Edom</hi> in <hi>Num.</hi> 20. when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> paſſed through their country, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſent a faire ambaſſage, and deſired a peaceable, and free way, and urgeth him by many arguments, and moves it the ſecond time, when he found him ſo ſtiffe that he would not encline to the motion, they turned another way, ſo reſpective was he to that great man, though he were averſe in his affections. So in <hi>David</hi> towards <hi>Saul</hi> when he hath him at a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage as may be, there is not one unreſpective word comes from him: if hee have occaſion to ſpeake to him himſelfe, or to ſpeak of him to others, his words and carriage were ever loyall and faithfull, and full of reverence. How ever ſome people disfigured him to him, certainly there was no paſſage of his life that
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:158707:106"/>had the leaſt touch of diſloyaltie to him. He knew he was the Lords anointed, and it was not a private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury that could waſh off his dutie that he ought him as his Prince.</p>
            <p>The like we ſee in our bleſſed Lord, how reſpective he was in all his carriage towards thoſe in authoritie; how fairely he ſpeaks in regard of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to infringe any right or priviledg of that Prince: nay, paying tribute that he need not, becauſe he would not give offence. And how ſoon did <hi>Paul</hi> retract that word that he ſent out haſtily, and ſharply againſt <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias, God ſhall ſmite thee thou whited wall? Act.</hi> 23. he ingenuouſly profeſſed that he did not <hi>know him to bee the ruler of the people.</hi> And <hi>Cyprian</hi> taking occaſion to ſpeak of that place, ſaith he, they were <hi>Sacerdotes, &amp;c.</hi> men unworthy of the place that they held, yet <hi>Paul</hi> was of that mind, that the very ſhadow of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he would not neglect, he would doe that that was due to the place they maintained. As our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour himſelf, for all the prieſthood was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved in his time, he diminiſhed none of the right, and due of it: but when he had healed the man, he bid him <hi>goe away, and ſhew himſelfe to the Prieſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The uſe of it meets with ſuch in theſe times that ſpie imperfections in the practiſes of men to diſpenſe with themſelves in the duties due to their places. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> could have ſo reaſoned here; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was a wicked man, and a perſecutor of Gods people, and <hi>Moſes</hi> had a great commiſſion himſelf: but he loved not to irritate and provoke him, and uſe him unbefitting a Magiſtrate: no more ſhould other men. Let me tell you, Religion and pietie, eate not out good manners
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:158707:106"/>and Civilitie. It is not the greateſt zeale of a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinne that will beare him out in rude unmanner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. Even men that are wicked are to be uſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their place they maintaine; if they be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo prophane, if they have dignitie it muſt bee reverenced and their perſons reſpected, <hi>Moſes</hi> kindly condeſcends to <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay, Did not <hi>Eliſha</hi> the prophet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid his man to ſalute any? Therefore there is a time when men may let downe theſe actions of common courteſie.</p>
            <p>Let not that be pretended. The meaning is hee ſhould make ſuch expedition that he ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, as men in complements: for that would hinder the worke.</p>
            <p>And although Saint <hi>John</hi> ſay, that there are ſome men that we ſhould not bid God ſpeed: It intimates onely an intimate familiaritie that is forbidden.</p>
            <p>Or elſe ſecondly, ſuch ſalutations as carry appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the evill wayes that a man is found in. But for common offices of humanitie and kindneſſe they are not forbidden. Chriſt would have his Apoſtles when they came to any place, to ſalute the houſe. If a man bee never ſo flagiciouſly wicked, nay if he bee excommunicated, which is the higheſt curſe that can light on him; for all that civill courteſies muſt not be denied. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> uſed <hi>Theodoſius</hi> with all reſpect, though he were excommunicated. And he that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated is not more then a heathen, but as a heathen, and if ſo, the heathen muſt be uſed fairely and kindly, and not irritated and provoked, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the dignitie they maintaine. Therefore whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:158707:107"/>men except againſt the perſons of men, give the place the honour that is due. So did <hi>Moſes</hi> with <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> he would not goe back from that hee had ſaid, leſt he ſhould impaire the honour of ſo great a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate. So much for that. <hi>Be it according to thy Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond thing I obſerve, that is, the cheerfulneſſe of <hi>Moſes</hi> undertaking this buſineſſe; for marke, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſpeech when we yeeld to a mans motion, what ſay we? Be it ſo, I am content, your word ſhall ſtand, I will do as you have ſaid: this argueth a cheerfull and willing performance. And <hi>Moſes</hi> being about a worke of mercy, to remove a judgement, this cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe ſets out the worke. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith if a man ſhew mercy, he ſhould doe it cheerfully, with hilaritie, with a kind of pleaſantneſſe. The ſame Apoſtle, he forbids the contrary: for he would not have men doe it out of ſorrow or grudgingly, inforcedly, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.2. and he gives a very good reaſon: for God loves a cheerfull giver. If it be in that ſervice that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires for himſelf; if it be an office of love to our brethren, cheerfulneſſe hath ever a ſpeciall commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. rich men are wiſhed to be <hi>ready to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute.</hi> That is the cheerfull affection that is ſpoken of. And works of mercy are compared to ſowing in the Scriptures. Every man deſires a faire ſeed-time: ſo every man ſhould give chearefully, for the more cheerfull the ſeed-time, the more expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there is of the harveſt. It is ſaid in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. <hi>The good man is mercifull;</hi> the old tranſlation reads it, <hi>the pleaſant, the merry man is mercifull.</hi> And <hi>Auſtin</hi> reads it, <hi>the ſweet man.</hi> And why? he gives a very good reaſon for it: for ſaith he, it maks a man ſweet in
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:158707:107"/>the noſtrills of God, when hee is cheerfull in doing that that is good; Whereas on the other ſide, if it be neceſſitated, and extorted from him, ſaith <hi>Auſtin,</hi> God will poure him out of his mouth as a man doth that that is unſavory and unſweet that troubles his tongue, that is fit for nothing but ejection.</p>
            <p>Now this cheerfulneſſe when a man is to doe good, ſhould appeare three wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">Firſt, a man ſhould find in his heart: <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.10. ſaith the Lord, <hi>thou ſhalt give him in his need, and thou ſhalt not find thine heart grieved, when thou giveſt.</hi> Thou ſhalt not find thy bowels locked up, ſo the word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth in the Epiſtle of <hi>John,</hi> the locking up of a mans bowels. A man muſt not find his heart ſtraitned, but be ſo cheerfull in his diſpoſition for this purpoſe, as if he rejoyced in the opportunities that God offers for the exerciſe of his charitie.</p>
            <p n="2">Secondly, there muſt be cheerfulneſſe in a mans countenance: for if a man do a work of mercy with an auſtere look, and a clouded brow, he puts gravell into that bread he gives, and ſoures the favour hee would beſtow, ſo as it is unacceptable. Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of a man <hi>with an evill eye,</hi> and bids eate not his bread, that when he ſees a man eate his meat, wiſheth him choak't, that when he gives a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he caſts an eye after it as if he wiſhed it in his purſe againe: ſuch a mans charitie would not be had, if a man could be without it.</p>
            <p n="3">Thirdly, there muſt be cheerfulneſſe in a mans words. Thus it is ſaid that <hi>Joſeph ſpake comfortably to his brethren.</hi> And ſo <hi>Boaz</hi> to <hi>Ruth,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> to the poore <hi>Egyptian</hi> ſervant; And ſo our bleſſed Lord to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:158707:108"/>the woman that came trembling before him, and was afraid of being checked, he did not onely comfort her, but perfect the worke of mercy on her.</p>
            <p>For the uſe of it, it meets with many in theſe dayes, there be thoſe that their hearts are dead in them, as <hi>Naballs,</hi> like a ſtone, there is no cheerfulneſſe in their inward man, they will doe but ſo much as the Law compells them, and there is an end. Or it may be when it is racked out with importunity, and extreame ſolicitation that is done, and nothing elſe, which as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith is to give, not out of judgement, but out of a deſire to be free from importunity; there are a number of theſe ſponges in the world that ſuck a great deale, but you muſt ſqueeze them before you can get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing from them. How do theſe ever think to have thanks of God? he loves a <hi>cheerfull giver;</hi> or of men? when <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith a man that receives a benefit from him, he doth not receive it, but it is wrung from him: therefore he thinks not himſelf ſo obliged to requitall, or to be reſponſary for ſuch a favour.</p>
            <p>Secondly, you have thoſe, that if they enlarge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any matter of bountie, and charitie, they brow-beate the poore, thoſe that need them; they look ſo auſterely and ſullenly, and ſuperciliouſly as if they would eate them, as if as the <hi>Baziliske</hi> they would kill them with their looks.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, you have thoſe, that if they do any thing, they do it with ſuch language and ſo rate the poore man as if he were a dog rather then a man, and bore Gods Image as well as he. The ſonne of <hi>Syrack</hi> gives better counſell, <hi>Blemiſh not thy good deeds with evill words, for ſometimes a good word is better then the gift,</hi> and ſo it is.</p>
            <pb n="203" facs="tcp:158707:108"/>
            <p>Therefore in the ſecond place, it is a uſe of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to us all to find our hearts cheerfull upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions that God miniſtreth for the exerciſe of our charitie. We are about to commemorate the greateſt favour that God ever did, in ſending his Sonne to take our nature, and to die. If our hearts be open, it is well: O let us bleſſe God for the opportunities he mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth to us; for the abilitie he hath given to us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the bowels of thoſe that are neceſſitated. And let us thank God that wee are not in a condition of want, but that God hath given us ſome abilitie to give. Secondly, let us be cheerfull in our countenance. And thirdly, in our words, let us ſpeake <hi>Gnaleb,</hi> to the hearts of thoſe that are in neceſſitie, as the Hebrew is; give them the comfort that is fit for them, for with ſuch ſacrifice God is pleaſed. So much for the yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now he comes to the reaſon, <hi>That thou mayſt know that there is none like the Lord our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now beloved, while <hi>Moſes</hi> aſſigneth this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, let all men be ſatisfied that thought <hi>Moſes</hi> indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreet in yeelding to the motion; Now you ſee his ayme, he intends the glory of God, he intends to teach <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſuch a leſſon as he never learned before. If he had done it in his owne time, he had not promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the glory of God ſo much; therefore now it makes him juſtifiable, and makes him an example to us, which ſhall be the obſervation.</p>
            <q>In all our actions to ayme at the glory of God.</q>
            <p>It is the Queene of all cauſes, the end of all things, the glory of God. <hi>Joſhua</hi> perſwades <hi>Achan</hi> to a full and free confeſſion from this way, to give glory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:158707:109"/>God, though he knew that he ſhould expoſe his life to danger, yet let him give glory to God, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 7. It is the counſell of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 22.23. <hi>O ye of the ſeed of Iſrael glorifie the Lord.</hi> And it is the practiſe of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> if you marke it, <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. when he brought the Arke, and danced before it, and was reproached by his wife that reliſhed not thoſe good things, ſaith he, <hi>I have done it before the Lord,</hi> which <hi>Toſtatus</hi> interpreting ſaith, <hi>I have done it to the honour of God,</hi> thou ſayſt I am vile, I care not if I were more baſe, <hi>ſo God may be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, I will be more vile.</hi> It is that that God himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents with man for, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, I will heare thee, and thou ſhalt glorifie me.</hi> There is a ſuppoſition of a day of trouble; and an impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a dutie, we muſt call upon God: and Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, Man muſt glorifie him, and God will heare. So you ſhall find it is the counſell of our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men that others may ſee your good works and glorifie your Father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Matth.</hi> 5.16. It is that that our bleſſed Saviour ſets downe in the firſt petition of the Lords prayer, <hi>hallowed be thy name;</hi> It is that that our bleſſed Lord in his practiſe had reſpect to, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.4. <hi>Father</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have glorified thee on earth.</hi> It is that that <hi>Paul</hi> would have to be remembred in all our actions, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you eate or drinke, or whatſoever you doe, doe all to the glory of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. The children of God have been ſo ſenſible of Gods honour that they have not dared to doe the leaſt thing whereby they might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire ir. The ſenſe of Gods honour made <hi>Abraham</hi> compoſe that jarre betweene <hi>Lot</hi> and him. This is that that kept <hi>Joſeph</hi> from ſatisfying the laſcivious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:158707:109"/>of his miſtris. This kept <hi>Mordecai</hi> from bowing to <hi>Haman:</hi> he would not have ſtood to give that proud <hi>Perſian</hi> reverence but for this. Firſt, it was more then civill that he required. Secondly, he was an <hi>Agagite</hi> that God had curſed, in both which reſpects he ſhould have diminiſhed the glory of God. It was reſpect to this that kept <hi>Daniel</hi> from eating his portion of meate, and the three children from bowing to the Image. This made <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſo zealous, that they flew in among the people when they would have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to them, becauſe it intrenched upon the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. This made <hi>Peter</hi> refuſe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that <hi>Cornelius</hi> would have done; and the Angel refuſe it from the hands of <hi>John,</hi> becauſe they knew they ſhould wrong God in his glory. And this was the reaſon that the fathers of the Church, when there was a motion made for the compoſing of differences betweene them, and ſome <hi>Arian</hi> heretiques that ſtood up: a little would have done it, the leaſt letter in the Alphabet, <hi>Iota,</hi> in the words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, they would not lend a word, not a ſyllable, not a letter; why? becauſe they were jealous of giving away the honour of God, and that that belonged to his glory. And what is the reaſon that we joyne not with thoſe in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in giving ſuch unlimited ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and to other Saints, but that we are afraid to take from God, and give to the creature? we muſt be jealous of his glory. Why do we not pray to Saints as they doe? becauſe it is due to God, and it is an impeachment of his honour ſince invocation is proper to him.</p>
            <p>The children of God are ſo zealous of his glory,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:158707:110"/>that they regard not their goods, no not their lives to ſet it forward; <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Phil,</hi> 1.20. <hi>I rejoyce whether by life or death God ſhall be glorified,</hi> hee cared not for his life. So wee ſee in our bleſſed Lord himſelfe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.27. <hi>Father, what ſhall I ſay? free me from this houre: but yet I came into the world for this houre, glorifie thy name.</hi> As man, he deſired the cup might paſſe from him: but when he conſidered that God intended his glory in his ſuffiering, <hi>Father</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>glorifie thy name</hi> what ever come.</p>
            <p>Nay the Children of God have been ſo zealous to promote Gods glory, that they have not regarded their owne ſalvation. It is a notable inſtance of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> who was conceited that if God ſhould deſtroy the people now, part of his glory would bee impaired, ſaith he, Lord if thou wilt doe this <hi>raſe me out of the book of life.</hi> Rather then Gods honour ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired among the heathen that were apt to take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to blaſpheme God, <hi>Moſes</hi> was willing to forfeit his owne ſalvation. So <hi>Paul</hi> for the ſame <hi>Iſrael,</hi> hee was content to be <hi>Anathema</hi> for them. The glory of God in their ſalvation was ſo deare to him. Thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective the children of God have ever been to bring glory to God in all their actions.</p>
            <p>But one thing will bee queſtioned, what man can give glory to God? As <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> ſaid of Chriſt, I have <hi>need to be baptized of thee, and comeſt thou to me?</hi> God had need to give us glory, and honour, and he muſt give it us if we have any true honour. Are wee like to bring glory to him? to ſet forth his glory? Was not God glorious and happy before ever there were Angels or men to praiſe him?</p>
            <pb n="207" facs="tcp:158707:110"/>
            <p>Saith <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> God is not the better if wee praiſe him, or the worſe if we diſpraiſe him: what can this worthleſſe filme of fleſh that tumbles up and downe our mouthes, adde to the glory of God.</p>
            <p>The ſchoolemen anſwer, God accepts it to increaſe his glory <hi>ad extra,</hi> though <hi>ad intra</hi> there bee no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, or diminution.</p>
            <p>Therefore for the uſe of it, it meets with a number in the world of whom the Apoſtles ſpeech will bee verified, they <hi>ſeek their owne,</hi> but not the glory of God; men build, but as the builders of <hi>Babel,</hi> to get themſelves a name. Marke, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> to get themſelves a name, not God the glory. So <hi>Calvin</hi> obſerves concerning that paſſage out of the mouth of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar. Is not this great Babel that I have built for my honour, &amp;c.</hi> Marke, all is for himſelf, not for the glory of God or the good of the State. So there are a number that do almes, they performe the worke, but as the Phariſees, not for the glory of God, but for their owne prayſe, they do <hi>their works that they may be ſeen of men.</hi> So there are a number that make profeſſion of Religion; what! for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God? No, to build up themſelves in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world, that men may conceite of them to be religious. So there are thoſe that doe good works ſometimes; Is it for the glory of God? No, for their owne temporall ends; or it may be as the Papiſts to merit by them, that they may be ſaid to be their own Saviours: So Gods glory is made the laſt, man ſets his owne ends firſt; Take heed, if God have not his firſt end in his glory, our glory ſhall be our ſhame.</p>
            <p>Therefoae let us take heed ever, that firſt our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:158707:111"/>be the glory of God, whether we eate or drink, do all to his praiſe and honour, and whatſoever wee can doe by any meanes promote it. Art thou a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate? reſpect Gods glory in that. Art thou a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter? preach not thy ſelfe, but have a care to advance the glory of God, and build up the body of his Sonne. Art thou a father of children and a maſter? in the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing of them look to the glory of God. Doſt thou deſire iſſue? look not ſo much to have ſome to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate thy memory, but ſet ke it as a holy ſeed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God may be glorified. Art thou a rich man? ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God with thy ſubſtance. Art thou honorable? improve thy honour to the glory God. What eſtate ſoever thou art in, looke principally to promote the glory of God; It is the end of all things. <hi>God hath made all things for his owne glory,</hi> and ſhould it not bee the end of our actions? Secondly, <hi>In him we live, move, and have our being,</hi> ſhould not wee live to his glory? He is our <hi>Alpha,</hi> from him we came; ſhould hee not bee our <hi>Omega,</hi> to whom wee ſhould tend? Therefore as all the Rivers come from the Sea, and pay all their tribute to that great Lord, ſo let all our actions tend to him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, while wee glorifie God, wee honour our ſelves, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerves upon that in the Lords Prayer, <hi>hallowed be thy name,</hi> ſaith he, underſtand it well, and thou prayeſt for thy ſelfe: for when thou prayeſt that Gods name may be hallowed, thou pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that thy ſelfe may be ſanctified, when thou hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt-God thou honoreſt thy ſelf, and <hi>thoſe that honour him, he will honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us look to it, and ſeriouſly intend it, and be farre
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:158707:111"/>from doing any thing whereby we may diſhonour God. It was the fault of <hi>David,</hi> he did that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the enemies of God blaſphemed. It was the fault of thoſe in the time of Chriſt, they diſhonored him. It is that that <hi>Paul</hi> layes to the charge of the Jewes, they cauſed Gods name to be evill ſpoken of among the heathen. It is that that I feare many of us are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of, that by our lewd carriage we cauſe Religion, and the name of God to be evill ſpoken of in <hi>Gath,</hi> and in the ſtreets of <hi>Askalon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every ingenuous nature is ſenſible of the houſe hee ſprings of, and would by no meanes blemiſh it: <hi>Shall he abuſe our ſiſter as a whore?</hi> ſay the ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> to their father. Every good child is ſenſible of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his father, and every ſubject of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his country, and ſhall not we be of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God? He is jealous of his honour, and if we ſuffer it to fall in our hands, we ſhall ſmart: for God can glorifie himſelfe in our confuſion. So much of that. Now for the words themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is none like the Lord our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A moſt true ſaying, you have it every where in Scripture, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.26. <hi>There is none like the God of Jeſhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. <hi>O Lord thou art great, and there is none like to thee,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.23. ſaith <hi>Solomon. There is none like thee O Lord either in heaven above, or in the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, Pſal.</hi> 86.8. <hi>There is none like thee O God, neither are the workes of others like thine, Eſay</hi> 46.9. <hi>I am God, and there is none like to me, Jer.</hi> 10.6, 7. twiſe over, <hi>There is none like the Lord, there is none like the Lord, Micah</hi> 7.18. <hi>Who is like to thee?</hi> So every where the Scripture ſaith, there is none like to God.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Maccabees</hi> were called ſo from <hi>Judas Maccabeus,</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:158707:112"/>and he was called ſo from the letters he carried in his Enſigne, and they were <hi>Mem, Caph, Aleph,</hi> and <hi>Jod;</hi> The meaning of it is this, <hi>who is like thee O Lord? among the Gods there is none.</hi> So he that ſtrove with the Dragon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. <hi>Michael,</hi> the ſignification of his name is, who is like as God? <hi>There is none like God.</hi> I could inſtance in a number of particulars: take theſe foure.</p>
            <p>There is none like him in veritie, and truth: <hi>for he is the onely true God.</hi> So you have it, 1 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 1. The Idols of the heathens were but Idols, and an Idoll is nothing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. that is, nothing to that a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits him to bee. The Hebrewes call them <hi>Elilim</hi> ſome ſay, <hi>quaſi al elohim,</hi> becauſe they are not Gods, but it is better from another word <hi>Elili,</hi> that ſignifies nothing. God is the onely true God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, none is like him in unitie; The Gods of the heathens were infinite, every Citie, every Towne, every Hamlet had their Gods. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> cals them, The broode of Gods: and that Polytheiſme brought Atheiſme into the world. It is not ſo with God, <hi>Heare Iſrael, the Lord thy God is one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is none like him in puritie. The Gods of the heathens, were good followes. Who can indure to heare of a God that ſometimes would thunder, and ſometimes commmit adultery? The Idols are called ſometimes in Scriptures, <hi>dunghill Gods.</hi> So the Idolls of the heathen were ſo obſcene, and filthy and abominable, that they might well be ſo called. It is not ſo with God, he is <hi>the holy one of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. Holy and reverend is his name.</hi> And the Angels themſelves call him <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth;</hi>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:158707:112"/>and his pure eyes can indure no iniquitie. So he is a holy God.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, none is like him in power. The Gods of the heathen, and thoſe that worſhipped thoſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary deities that men ſet up, they could not defend thoſe that truſted in them, nor defend themſelves. How oft were they carried captive, as we read in ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? <hi>Jacob</hi> when he was gone from <hi>Laban</hi> was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued with a great deale of hoſtilitie; and his firſt cry is, <hi>why haſt thou ſtollen my Gods?</hi> Proper Gods that might be ſtollen. So it is a good ſpeech, <hi>Judg.</hi> 6. <hi>Let Baal plead for himſelfe.</hi> What! is his Image demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed? is he not able to revenge his owne quarrell? <hi>Let him plead for himſelfe.</hi> So <hi>Dagon</hi> though the great God of the Philiſtims, yet hee could not keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from being broken by a fall. <hi>Senacherib</hi> found a difference betweene the Gods of thoſe countries that he had ſubdued, and the God of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> he found hee was ſuch a one as could not be ſtood againſt.</p>
            <p>Not to multiply more, ſee the power of God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in that place, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation was between <hi>Elias,</hi> and the Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> whoſe ſacrifice ſhould be accepted firſt. The Prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> leaped upon the Altar, and as a company of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and bedlams, cut themſelves with knives till the blood guſhed out, they cryed and roared till their throats were dry, and all would not bring a ſparke of fire. <hi>Eliah</hi> prayes to God, and it was done, and the fire comes, and conſumes not the ſacrifice onely, but licks up all about it; ſo the people cry out, <hi>The Lord he is God,</hi> not <hi>Baal,</hi> but <hi>Jehovah,</hi> for he exceeds all. But this is not a thing that we need ſtand on; we muſt come nearer. For ſurely <hi>Moſes</hi> intended that <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:158707:113"/>muſt know God to be the onely Lord. How could this be? <hi>Moſes</hi> no doubt underſtood that by this judgement on him, and by the removing of it his eyes would be ſo in lightned, that he ſhould ſee there is none like God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God is known in afflicting of judgments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that eſpecially, firſt, when it is a ſtrange judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when it is a fearefull judgment. As that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Sodome,</hi> when there came fire from heaven. Saith <hi>Salvianus,</hi> when God ſent hell out of heaven, fire and brimſtone. So when the earth ſwallowed <hi>Corah,</hi> and his company, it was a ſtrange and fearefull judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Secondly, ſometime a judgment is remarkable, when it is unſeaſonable in regard of the time; as the eclipſe, and darkneſſe at Chriſts ſuffering, for it was not a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Eclipſe: God ſhewed his power, he made the Sun withdraw his light, and left the earth wrapped in obſcuritie.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Gods power is more remarkable when it is ſudden, ſuch as that that <hi>Samuel</hi> brought upon the people, that in the middeſt of harveſt at his word there came thunder and lightning, and abundance of raine, that ſpoyled their indeavours. For as <hi>Toſtatus</hi> ſaith upon the place, he looked not Aſtronomically; he ſtayed not till there was a meete time of bringing things about; but preſently, and that made it more fearfull to the people.</p>
            <p>And as in the inflicting of judgments Gods hand may eaſily be ſeen, and is remarkable, ſo in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of it, and that I thinke <hi>Moſes</hi> intends. For when a judgment hath been long upon a people, and they have ſmarted ſoundly, and have uſed all meanes
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:158707:113"/>they can deviſe, and yet it is not removed: in the end turning themſelves to God, and he removing it, this makes them know the Lord to be God. This was <hi>Pharaohs</hi> caſe, to which <hi>Moſes</hi> had reſpect when he ſaid this, <hi>That thou mayſt know that there is none like the Lord.</hi> For you know the hand of God was heavy upon him by the Frogs, they were ſuch annoyance to him and his ſervants, that they could have no meat dreſſed, or be quiet in their beds, it was a terrible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance, no queſtion he conſulted with the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians to remove them. They could not do it: God gave them leave to bring them, but they had neither leave, nor power to take them away. God uſeth the devill ſometimes in the execution of juſtice: but never to doe a worke of mercy. The bringing of the Frogs was a judgment, the taking of them away was a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. It was not for the devill to do that. It is like enough that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſupplicated God: all will not doe, till <hi>Pharaoh</hi> deſire <hi>Moſes.</hi> So that now when all is gone by the prayer of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he muſt needs know the Lord to be the God, that there is none like him. When <hi>Eliah</hi> told <hi>Ahab</hi> that there ſhould be no raine in <hi>Iſrael</hi> but according to his word, and that the drought ſhould continue three years, and ſix moneths: you may thinke this, that <hi>Ahab</hi> ſought meanes for the preſervation of the Cattell, and conſulted with his great God that he worſhipped to remove this judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it would not doe, it muſt be the God of <hi>Elias</hi> that muſt doe it: and that <hi>Elias</hi> that was the bridle of heaven, as <hi>Baſill</hi> calls him, he muſt unlock heaven, and poure out raine abundantly. So the obduracie of the Philiſtims was ſo great, that having took the Arke of God among them, they indured ſeven moneths
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:158707:114"/>vexation of hemeroids, and many people died, yet they held out till at laſt they ſaw no time could cure it. They conſulted with their Prieſt, and hee ſaid, go, and make ſuch an offering, and ſaith he, <hi>give glory to the God of Iſrael:</hi> as if he had ſaid, it is not your <hi>Dagon,</hi> nor all the means you can uſe, that can free you from this judgement, but acknowledg that it is Gods judgment, &amp; that there is <hi>none like him Ionas</hi> r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns away from his commiſſion, and a whirlwind followes him, and ſeizeth upon the whole ſhip, they were all in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger through him. They were not wanting to uſe all meanes to ſecure themſelves, every man called upon his God; they unladed the ſhip, and caſt away whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might be an incumbrance, and hurt to them, they left nothing unattempted, they rowed with all ſeduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to bring it to land. All would not doe, it muſt be the God of <hi>Jonas</hi> that muſt doe it, all their Gods could not do it. There is <hi>none like the God of Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So it was with <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 27. hee was in a great ſtorme, for three dayes they never ſaw Sun nor Star; at the laſt, <hi>Paul</hi> having revealed from God that they ſhould all be ſafe, he bids them take a good heart to themſelves, for none of them ſhould periſh: but it was the God that <hi>Paul</hi> ſerved that muſt do it, and muſt help them in this extremitie, and ſo he did. <hi>Euſebius</hi> in the fifth book of his hiſtory, Chap. 5. tells, that under <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> the Emperour, there was a Legion of Chriſtian Souldiers. The army was in great diſtreſſe: for the enemy came cloſe to them, and they were exceedingly pinched for water. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Chriſtians betooke themſelves to prayer, thereupon the Lord ſent ſuch a thunder and lightning as diſcomfited the enemy, and ſuch abundance of
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:158707:114"/>raine, that ſatisfied their thirſt: ſo that Army was after called the thundering Legion. All that the Pagan Gods can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe, the God of the Chriſtians muſt do it: there is none like him.</p>
            <p>Therefore for the uſe of it. Let this teach us when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Lord to ſend us deliverance to acknowledge his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; to ſee Gods hand in it. Though there may bee ſome ſubordinate meanes uſed, give God the praiſe, let him have all the glory. I will but turne any of you back to ſome extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie you have beene in by ſickneſſe of body: ſome deſperate caſe you have been drawn to, was it thy wealth that would abate thy paine? was it thy friends that could keep off thy fit? was it thy former pleaſures could give thee comfort? Nay did it not increaſe thy vexation, thy guiltineſſe in the miſuſing of them, and in the diſtempered abuſe of them? did it not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thy dollour? could the Phyſitians helpe thee? did not they give thee for loſt? thy caſe was to be deplored, till it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this God to whom none is like to reſcue thee from the jawes of death. Haſt thou been left to tempeſts of mind; to terrours of ſoule? then tell mee, and ſpeake true from thy heart, did all thoſe carnall receipts of gaming, drinking, and buſineſſe, and whatſoever, did all help? were they not miſerable comforters, Phyſitians of no value? till God ſpake to thy conſcience peace, and ſaid to thy ſoule, <hi>I am thy ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> thou hadſt no comfort nor joy. It is impoſſible it ſhould be otherwiſe. There is no God like our God, he alone will do it, all things elſe are as reeds of Egypt, nothing can help, there is none like him. As that woman was anſwered by the King, <hi>O woman, if God do not help thee, how ſhall I help thee?</hi> There is no help from man unleſſe God ſtrike in. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſee God in thy deliverance, acknowledge his power; ſhare it not between the creator, and the creature: for it is the Lords doing that <hi>it might be mervailous in our eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="216" facs="tcp:158707:115"/>
            <p>
               <hi>That thou mayeſt know that there is none like the Lord.</hi> Marke here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The works of God ſo enlighten the wicked that though they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them not, yet they convince them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou ſhalt know that the Lord is God, and confeſſe that there is none like him, if it doe thee not good, it ſhall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy condemnation. So the works of God convince the judgments of wicked men, though they convert them not. And that is enough to make them inexcuſable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> when his hand was reſtored, he could not but ſay, there was no God like the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that the Prophet was a true Prophet. So <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> when he was humbled by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, hee knew the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. So <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> when God gives abilitie to <hi>Daniel</hi> to interpret his dreame, and to tell him what it was without, being informed of it, he ſaith, <hi>there is no God like thine.</hi> So afterward when he ſaw the deliverance of the three children out of the furnace, he ſaith, <hi>there is no God like him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay not that he became a good man afterward: yet ſo farre the light beat upon his eyes, that though it enlightned him not, it dazeled him. So <hi>Darius</hi> acknowledged the God of <hi>Daniel</hi> to be the great God when he preſerved him in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of the ravenous Lions. So <hi>Antiochus,</hi> 2 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 9. though he ſtood out a great while in the obſtinacie of his heart, at the laſt he ſubmitted, and acknowledged the great God, that no fleſh could ſtand againſt him.</p>
            <p>For the uſe of it, it is this; to labour for more then this; for fince this befals wicked men, to be convinced in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we ſhould make further uſe of it then ſo. It is pitie but wee ſhould go further then the ſonnes of <hi>Belial.</hi> Nay Belzebub himſelfe goes thus farre, the <hi>devills beleeve and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> And there was a time when the devill confeſſed our Lord: and it is good for us to goe further then they: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:158707:115"/>when the hand of God is againſt thee, acknowledge not onely Gods power, but go forward, humble thy ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, finde out that <hi>Achan,</hi> find out thy finne, proteſt againſt it: and when this is done, take thy leave of thy finne, divorce thy ſelfe from thine iniquitie, and never more renew thy acquaintance with it. This is the fruit that ought to be of Gods deliverances, not onely to ſee that God delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, but to what end, that thou mighteſt be more holy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</p>
            <p>O it grieves my ſoule to thinke, that many people, though they be not ſo atheiſticall but they will acknowledge Gods hand in ſmiting, and in delivering of them: yet God knowes they make no good uſe of it. I will goe back but to the great plague, when our waters were turned into blood: did not the deſtroying Angel that marched furiouſly as <hi>Jehu,</hi> make the ſtouteſt heart to tremble? No queſtion. And the retreate was as ſudden as the increaſe. Every man can ſay, God was to be magnified for that, and it was a very great mercy; but what uſe do we make of it? God looks for fruit. If wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it to be Gods worke, we are convinced of Gods power: but what fruit is there? The devill is convinced of Gods power: but have we brought forth fruit? Oh, ſome fruits we ſupererogate with God in. If it be blaſphemy, or luſt, or oppreſſion, and uncharitableneſſe, God ſhall have more then he deſires: but theſe are not the fruits that God looks for. Are not we as ambitious, as proud, as exceſſive, as fraudulent as ever we were? What one finne in this Citie (ſhall I ſay) is removed? nay I would it were abated. Nay beloved, I feare, and I feare to ſpeak it; we are againe ready, and white to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sicle. O, it is a fearefull thing when the comming of Gods judgements ſhall make us humble, and the removing of it ſhall make us unthankfull: for this ſhewes that that humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation was inforced, and not ingenuous. Therefore let us look
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:158707:116"/>that the next cup be more bitter; look to it, there will worſe things befall us, becauſe we acknowledg the power of God and have not brought forth fruit worthy of ſo great a bleſſing.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, to ſhut up all, there is one thing more, and that is this, <hi>Our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no God like <hi>our God;</hi> In what a neare relation God ſtands to his people, I ſhewed before. All that I will do is by way of application, to worke upon us to a holy recognition of Gods favour that he hath drawne us nearer to him then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands in the world. There is a great deale of divinitie in Pronouns, ſaith <hi>Luther:</hi> I am ſure, there is a great deale of comfort. For God to be the God of all the world in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall latitude, it is not ſo much, but to be our God; to incloſe, and impropriate this God to us, that we ſhould ſay he is our God, and we are his people, this is a wondrous comfort.</p>
            <p>Now then what is required of us? As wee draw this God neare our ſelves, and ſay as <hi>Thomas</hi> did, <hi>my God, and my Lord, Joh.</hi> 20. As we draw neare to him: So let our converſation be worthy of ſo neare a relation. <hi>For God will be honored in all that come ſo neare him.</hi> He can better indure the wickedneſſe of thoſe that are out of the Church, and the pales of it, then the prophaneneſſe of thoſe that are in it. He will have thoſe that he hath taken ſo eſpeciall a charge of it, that they be holy, &amp; plous, &amp; that their converſations be as becometh the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Therefore as oft as we reflect upon our relation, let it be ever a motive to a holy converſation. For to ſay our God, and to be full of groſſe ſine, as we are, it is a foule ſoloeciſme. It is that that God moſt abhorres, for he is a pure God, and his pure eyes cannot indure iniquity. We muſt live to his glory, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him that hath drawn us ſo near him; and then we are ſure that he will not leave us till he have perfected us in glory; Chriſt ſhall be ours, and God through Chriſt ſhall be ours; and God through Chriſt being ours, all things ſhall be ours.</p>
